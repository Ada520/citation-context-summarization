we designed these 4 features to capture information that will be helpful to the why questions, since it has been observed in prior work (charniak et al, 2000; riloff and thelen, 2000) that the answer 127 sentence to a why question tends to follow (or precede) the sentence in the story that has the most number of word matches with the question. 
naturally, our current work on question answering for the reading comprehension task is most related to those of (hirschman et al, 1999; charniak et al, 2000; riloffand thelen, 2000; wang et al, 2000). 
the words used in (riloff and thelen, 2000) are "happen", "take place" "this", "story". 
subsequently, the work of (riloffand thelen, 2000) and (chaxniak et al, 2000) improved the accuracy further to 39.7% and 41%, respectively. 
it has been observed in prior work (charniak et al, 2000; riloff and thelen, 2000) that such sentences may be more likely to be the answer sentences to some question type (for example, dateline can answer to when questions).
