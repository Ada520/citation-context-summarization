but koehn et al (2003) find that phrases longer than three words improve performance little, suggesting that data sparseness takes over for longer phrases. 
the inclusion of phrases longer than three words in translation resources has been avoided, as it has been shown not to have a strong impact on translation performance [koehn et al, 2003]. 
similarly, (koehn et al, 2003) propose a relative distortion model to be used with a phrase decoder. 
in the future, we plan to explore our discriminative framework on a full distortion model (koehn et al, 2003) or even a hierarchical model (chiang, 2005). 
for our experiments, we chose giza++ (och and ney, 2000) and the ra approach (koehn et al, 2003)— the best known alignment combination technique— as our initial aligners.1 4.2 tbl templates our templates consider consecutive words (of size 1, 2 or 3) in both languages.
