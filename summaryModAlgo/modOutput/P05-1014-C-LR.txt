(geffet and dagan, 2005), who exploited the distributional similarity approach over the web to address the same task as ours, obtained higher precision but substantially lower recall, considering only distributional candidates. 
recent attention to knowledge-rich problems such as question answering (pasca and harabagiu 2001) and textual entailment (geffet and dagan 2005) has encouraged natural language processing researchers to develop algorithms for automatically harvesting shallow semantic resources. 
the method for noun entailment acquisition by (geffet and dagan, 2005) is based on the idea of distributional inclusion, according to which one noun is entailed by the other if the set of occurrence contexts of the former subsumes that of the latter.
