as a general result, our experiments confirm previous studies on non-projective dependency parsing (nivre and nilsson, 2005; hall and novák, 2005; 512 mcdonald and pereira, 2006): the phenomenon of non-projectivity cannot be ignored without also ignoring a significant portion of real-world data (around 15a37for ddt, and 23a37for pdt). 
dependency-based representations have become increasingly popular in syntactic parsing, especially for languages that exhibit free or flexible word order, such as czech (collins et al, 1999), bulgarian (marinov and nivre, 2005), and turkish (eryi˘git and oflazer, 2006). 
thus, nivre and nilsson (2005) improve parsing accuracy for maltparser by projectivizing training data and applying an inverse transformation to the output of the parser, while hall and nov´ak (2005) apply post-processing to the output of charniak’s parser (charniak, 2000). 
the parser used is maltparser (nivre and hall, 2005; nivre et al, 2006), a freely available system that combines a deterministic parsing strategy with discriminative classifiers for predicting the next parser action. 
many thanks to the sdt people for granting the special license for conll-x and to tomaˇz erjavec for converting the danish dependency treebank13 (kromann, 2003); swedish: talbanken0514 (teleman, 1974; einarsson, 1976; nilsson et al, 2005); turkish: metusabancı treebank15 (oflazer et al, 2003; atalay et al, 2003).
