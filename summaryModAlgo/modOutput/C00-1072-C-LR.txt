these n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000). 
in order to generate quabs automatically, documents identified from ferret's automatic q/a system are first submitted to a topic representation module, which computes both topic signatures (lin and hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages. 
two methods are used:  topic signature (lin and hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s. 
to identify these terms,weusethelog-likelihoodstatisticsuggested by dunning (dunning 1993) and first used in summarization by lin and hovy (hovy and lin 2000).
