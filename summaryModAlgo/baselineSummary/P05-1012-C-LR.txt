a non-projective example from the czech prague dependency treebank (hajiË‡c et al, 2001) is also shown in figure 2. most previous dependency parsing models have focused on projective trees, including the work of eisner (1996), collins et al (1999), yamada and matsumoto (2003), nivre and scholz (2004), and mcdonald et al (2005). 
currently, the work on conditional parsing models appears to have culminated in large margin training (taskar et al, 2003; taskar et al, 2004; tsochantaridis et al, 2004; mcdonald et al, 2005), which currently demonstrates the state of the art performance in english dependency parsing (mcdonald et al, 2005). 
strong assumptions are also made in the case of mcdonald et al's (2005b) non-projective dependency parsing model.
