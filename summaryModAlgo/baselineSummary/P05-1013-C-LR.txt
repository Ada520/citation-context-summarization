table 2: transformations; t = transformation; as = attachment score (unlabeled) of τ−1(τ(∆t)) compared to ∆t maltparser is used with the parsing algorithm of nivre (2003) together with the feature model used for parsing czech by nivre and nilsson (2005). 
with the emergence of the important role of word-to-word relations in parsing (charniak, 2000; collins, 1996), dependency grammars have gained acertain popularity; e.g., yamada and matsumoto (2003) for english, kudo and matsumoto (2000; 2002), sekine et al (2000) for japanese, chung and rim (2004) for korean, nivre et al (2004) for swedish, nivre and nilsson (2005) for czech, among others. 
whether better parsing accuracy can be obtained by transforming 1about 2% of all dependencies are non-projective and about 25% of all sentences have a non-projective dependency graph (nivre and nilsson, 2005).
