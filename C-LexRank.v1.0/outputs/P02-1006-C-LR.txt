in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is mostly used (ravichandran and hovy, 2002):/
on the other hand, we have rerun ravichandran and hovy (2002)â€™s algorithm on our corpus. 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction. 
in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is usually followed (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
the approach followed for the generalisation is the one described by (alfonseca et al, 2006a; ruiz-casado et al, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to ravichandran and hovy (2002)'s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and named entity labels to the patterns.
