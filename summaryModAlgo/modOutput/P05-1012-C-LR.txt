strong assumptions are also made in the case of mcdonald et al's (2005b) non-projective dependency parsing model. 
moreover, the study of formal grammarsisonly partially relevant for research ondatadriven dependency parsing, where most systems are not grammar-based but rely on inductive inference from treebank data (yamada and matsumoto, 2003; nivre et al, 2004; mcdonald et al, 2005a). 
these results show that the discriminative spanning tree parsing framework (mcdonald et al, 2005b; mcdonald and pereira, 2006) is easily adapted across all these languages. 
this was done for supervised parsing in different ways by collins (1997), klein and manning (2003), and mcdonald et al (2005), all of whom considered intervening material or coarse distance classes when predicting children in a tree.
