in response, factoid question answering systems have evolved into two types: â€¢ use-knowledge: extract query words from the input question, perform ir against the source corpus, possibly segment resulting documents, identify a set of segments containing likely answers, apply a set of heuristics that each consults a different source of knowledge to score each candidate, rank them, and select the best (harabagiu et al, 2001; hovy et al, 2001; srihari and li, 2000; abney et al, 2000). 
examples of the use of nlp and ie in question answering include shallow parsing (kupiec, 1993), semantic parsing (litkowski 1999), named entity tagging (abney et al 2000, srihari and li 1999) and high-level ie (srihari and li, 2000).
