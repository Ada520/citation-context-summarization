yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003)) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document (e.g., pang and lee (2004)). 
many applications could benefit from these opinion analyzers, including product reputation tracking (e.g., morinaga et al (2002), yi et al (2003)), opinion-oriented summarization (e.g., cardie et al (2004)), and question answering (e.g., bethard et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003)). 
interestingly, yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) compared an individual-preference classifier against a relationship-based method, but didn‚Äôt combine the two; the ability to coordinate such algorithms is precisely one of the strengths of our approach. 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
lexical cues of differing complexities have been used, including single words and ngrams (e.g., (mullen and collier, 2004; pang et al, 2002; turney, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; wiebe et al, 2004)), as well as phrases and lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g, 
turney proposed the unsupervised method for sentiment classification (turney, 2002), and similar method is utilized by many other researchers (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
admittedly, the high accuracy achieved using such a simple set of features is somewhat surprising, although it is consistent with previous results on document-level subjectivity classification in which accuracies of 94-97% were obtained (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; wiebe et al, 2004). 
so far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (pang et al, 2002; morinaga et al, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; popescu and etzioni, 2005; wilson et al, 2005). 
most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level (pang et al, 2002; turney, 2002), or the sentence or word level (wiebe et al, 2004; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
for example, the following opinions contain claims but no sentiments: ‚Äúi believe the world is flat‚Äù ‚Äúthe gap is likely to go bankrupt‚Äù ‚Äúbin laden is hiding in pakistan‚Äù ‚Äúwater always flushes anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere‚Äù like yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), we want to automatically identify sentiments, which in this work we define as an explicit or implicit expression in text of the holder‚Äôs positive, negative, or neutral regard toward the claim about the topic. 
in addition to appraisal theory, subjectivity annotation of text in context has also been performed in yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), bruce and wiebe (1999), and wiebe et al (2004). 
for example, researchers (turney 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou 2003) have identified semantic correlation between words and views: positive words tend to appear more frequently in positive movie and product reviews and newswire article sentences that have a positive semantic orientation and vice versa for negative reviews or sentences with a negative semantic orientation. 
there is also a considerable amount of research on classification of text as subjective or objectiveù (wiebe et al 2001, yu and hatzivassiloglou 2003), a task that is not relevant for the processing of very brief pieces of direct customer feedback. 
other research efforts analyze opinion expressions at the sentence level or below to recognize opinions, their polarity, and their strength (e.g., dave et al (2003), pang and lee (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)). 
this amounts to performing binary text categorization under categories objective and subjective (pang and lee, 2004; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003); 2. determining document orientation (or polarity), as in deciding if a given subjective text expresses a positive or a negative opinion on its subject matter (pang and lee, 2004; turney, 2002); 3. determining the strength of document orientation, as in deciding e.g. 
second, a number of methods for subjectivity or sentiment analysis start with a set of seed words and then search through wordnet to find other subjective words (kamps and marx, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; hu and liu, 2004; kim and hovy, 2004; esuli and sebastiani, 2005). 
riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)) have shown that sentiment information can be extracted at the sentence, clause, or individual opinion expression level (fine-grained opinion information). 
there are studies on learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (turney and littman, 2003; pang et al, 2002; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; morinaga et al, 2002). 
dave et al (2003), riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), choi et al (2005), kim and hovy (2005), wiebe and riloff (2005)). 
recent computational work either focuses on sentence ‚Äòsubjectivity‚Äô (wiebe et al 2002; riloff et al 2003), concentrates just on explicit statements of evaluation, such as of films (turney 2002; pang et al 2002), or focuses on just one aspect of opinion, e.g., (hatzivassiloglou and mckeown 1997) on adjectives. 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) extend this approach by (1) applying it at the sentence level (instead of the document-level), (2) taking into account non-adjectival parts-of-speech, and (3) 1 for domain-specificity of sentiment classification see engstr√∂m (2004) and aue and gamon (2005). 
following the insight of yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), we made the basic and rough assumption that words that appear more often in newspaper editorials and letters to the editor than in non-editorial news articles could be potential opinion-bearing words (even though editorials contain sentences about factual events as well). 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), kim and hovy (2004), hu and liu (2004), and grefenstette et al (2001) all begin by first creating prior-polarity lexicons. 
this approach has been recently applied to the construction of paragraph-long answers (e.g., (blair-goldensohn et al, 2003; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003)). 
most prior work on the specific problem of categorizing expressly opinionated text has focused on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative (turney, 2002; pang, lee, and vaithyanathan, 2002; dave, lawrence, and pennock, 2003; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
dave et al (2003), riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), pang and lee (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)). 
so far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; pang et al, 2002; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; morinaga et al, 2002). 
in analyzing opinions (cardie et al, 2003; wilson et al, 2004), judging document-level subjectivity (pang et al, 2002; turney, 2002), and answering opinion questions (cardie et al, 2003; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003), the output of a sentence-level subjectivity classification can be used without modification. 
for example, yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) separated facts from opinions and assigned polarities only to opinions. 
the first group includes methods that rely on syntactic or co-occurrence patterns of words in large texts to determine their sentiment (e.g., (turney and littman, 2002; hatzivassiloglou and mckeown, 1997; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; grefenstette et al, 2004) and others). 
the annotations in yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) are sentence-level subjective vs. objective and polarity judgments. 
there is a large body of work on classifying the polarity of a document (e.g., pang et al (2002), turney (2002)), a sentence (e.g., liu et al (2003), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), kim and hovy (2004), gamon et al (2005)), a phrase (e.g., wilson et al (2005)), and a specific object (such as a product) mentioned in a document (e.g., morinaga et al (2002), yi et al (2003), popescu and etzioni (2005)). 
we wish to study opinion in general; our work most closely resembles that of (yu and hatzivassiloglou 2003). 
there have been attempts on tackling this so-called document-level subjectivity classification task, with very encouraging results (see yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) and wiebe et al (2004) for details). 
the field of sentiment classification has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years (pang and lee 2002, pang et al 2004, turney 2002, turney and littman 2002, wiebe et al 2001, bai et al 2004, yu and hatzivassiloglou 2003 and many others). 
the second is subjectivity classification of sentences, clauses, phrases, or word instances in the context of a particular text or conversation, either subjective/objective classifications or positive/negative sentiment classifications (e.g.,(riloff and wiebe, 2003; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; dave et al, 2003; hu and liu, 2004)). 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentence-level analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification. 
dave et al (2003), riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), pang and lee (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)).
