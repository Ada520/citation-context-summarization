we define the source and target projection of a hypothesis h by the proj operator which collects in order the words of a hypothesis along one language: projf(h) = braceleftbig fp : p∈uniontextui=1{jin}n∈[1,ni] bracerightbig proje(h) = braceleftbig ep : p∈uniontextui=1{lim}m∈[1,mi] bracerightbig if we denote by hf the set of hypotheses that have f as a source projection (that is, hf = {h : projf(h) ≡ f}), then our translation engine seeks ˆe = proje(ˆh) where: ˆh = argmax h∈hf s(h) the function we seek to maximize s(h) is a loglinear combination of 9 components, and might be better understood as the numerator of a maximum entropy model popular in several statistical mt systems(ochandney, 2002; bertoldietal., 2004; zens and ney, 2004; simard et al, 2005; quirk et al, 2005). 
recently, various works have improved the quality of statistical machine translation systems by using phrase translation (koehn et al, 2003; marcu et al, 2002; och et al, 1999; och and ney, 2000; zens et al, 2004). 
(zens and ney, 2004) obtain p(sj|ti) from smoothed relative-frequency estimates in a wordaligned corpus. 
we use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system (zens and ney, 2004; zens et al, 2005) including the following models: an n-gram language model, a phrase translation model and a word-based lexicon model. 
finally, we use pos features to parameterize a distortion model in a limited distortion decoder (zens and ney, 2004; tillmann and zhang, 2005).
