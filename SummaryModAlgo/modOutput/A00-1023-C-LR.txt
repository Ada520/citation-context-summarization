high performance qa systems (srihari and li 2000; harabagiu et al 2001). 
qa is different than search engines in two aspects: (i) instead of a string of keyword search terms, the query is a natural language question, necessitating question parsing, (ii) instead of a list of documents or urls, a list of candidate answers at phrase level or sentence level are expected to be returned in response to a query, hence the need for text processing beyond keyword indexing, typically supported by natural language processing (nlp) and information extraction (ie) (chinchor and marsh 1998, hovy, hermjakob and lin 2001, li and srihari 2000). 
it is worth noticing that in our experiment, the structural support used for answer-point identification only checks the binary links involving the asking point and the candidate answer points, instead of full template matching as proposed in (srihari and li, 2000). 
typically qa is supported by natural language processing (nlp) and ie [chinchor & marsh 1998] [hovy et al 2001] [srihari & li 2000]. 
if the expected answer types are typical named entities, information extraction engines (bikel et al 1999, srihari and li 2000) are used to extract candidate answers.
