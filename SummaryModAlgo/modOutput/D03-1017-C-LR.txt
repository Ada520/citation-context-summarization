yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
so far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (pang et al, 2002; morinaga et al, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; popescu and etzioni, 2005; wilson et al, 2005). 
riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)) have shown that sentiment information can be extracted at the sentence, clause, or individual opinion expression level (fine-grained opinion information). 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
second, a number of methods for subjectivity or sentiment analysis start with a set of seed words and then search through wordnet to find other subjective words (kamps and marx, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; hu and liu, 2004; kim and hovy, 2004; esuli and sebastiani, 2005).
