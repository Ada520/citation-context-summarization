the first of these, relative utility (ru) (radev et al, 2000) allows model summaries to consist of sentences with variable ranking. 
sentence extraction techniques (luhn, 1958; radev et al, 2000), on the other hand, compute a score for each sentence based on certain features and output the most highly ranked sentences. 
a straightforward approach for approximating sentence fusion can be found in the use of sentence extraction for multidocument summarization (carbonell and goldstein 1998; radev, jing, and budzikowska 2000; marcu and gerber 2001; lin and hovy 2002). 
evaluation methods we use the relative utility (ru) method (radev et al, 2000) to compare our various summaries.
