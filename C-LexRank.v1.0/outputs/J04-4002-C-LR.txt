in view of content-independency of the distortion and flat reordering models, several researchers (och et al, 2004; tillmann, 2004; kumar et al, 2005; koehn et al, 2005) proposed a more powerful model called lexicalized reordering model that is phrase dependent. 
standard phrase-based translation systems use a word distance-based reordering model in which non-monotonic phrase alignment is penalized based on the word distance between successively translated source phrases without considering the orientation of the phrase alignment or the identities of the source and target phrases (koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004). 
most current smt systems (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003) use a generative model for word alignment such as the freely available giza++ (och and ney, 2003), an implementation of the ibm alignment models (brown et al, 1993). 
recent work in statistical machine translation (mt) has sought to overcome the limitations of phrasebased models (marcu and wong, 2002; koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004) by making use of syntactic information. 
phrase-based statistical machine translation (smt) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (och and ney, 2004).
