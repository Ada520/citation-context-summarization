hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various nlp systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
there have been several approaches to automatically discovering lexico-semantic information from text (hearst 1992; riloff and shepherd 1997; riloff and jones 1999; berland and charniak 1999; pantel and lin 2002; fleischman et al 2003; girju et al 2003). 
in contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (riloff and jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (thelen and riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (collins and singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (agichtein and gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as question answering (lita and carbonell, 2004; fleischman et al, 2003).
