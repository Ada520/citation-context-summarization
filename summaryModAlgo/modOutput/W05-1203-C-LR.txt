in line with (corley and mihalcea, 2005), we define it as: s1(t,h) = summationdisplay (wt,wh)∈a simw(wt,wh)×idf(wh) summationdisplay wh∈wh idf(wh) (3) where idf(w) is the inverse document frequency of the word w. 
although these implications are uncontroversial, their automatic recognition is complex if we rely on models based on lexical distance (or similarity) between hypothesis and text, e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005). 
in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dectors: the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivationally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in wordnet, and, finally, a wordnet-based similarity (jiang and conrath, 1997).
