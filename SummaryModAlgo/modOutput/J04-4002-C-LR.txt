a common approach to phrase-based smt is to learn phrasal translation pairs from word-aligned training data (och and ney, 2004). 
the alignment template translation model (och and ney, 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the previous state of the art by moving from words to phrases as the basic unit of translation. 
words of parallel chinese-english data released by ldc, in order to train several statistical-based mt systems: pbmt, a strong state of the art phrase-based system that implements the alignment template model (och and ney, 2004); this is the system isi has used in the 2004 and 2005 nist evaluations. 
synchronous binarization for mt machine translation has made very good progress in recent times, especially, the so-called “phrasebased” statistical systems (och and ney, 2004). 
phrase-based statistical machine translation (smt) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (och and ney, 2004).
