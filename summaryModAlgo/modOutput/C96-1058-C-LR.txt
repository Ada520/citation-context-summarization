we re-implemented eisner's decoder (eisner, 1996), which searches among all projective parse trees, and the chu-liu-edmonds decoder (chu and liu, 1965; edmonds, 1967), which searches in the space of both projective and non-projective parses. 
we address this concern in section 4. 2.2.2 projective trees it is well known that projective dependency parsing using edge based factorization can be handled with the eisner algorithm (eisner, 1996). 
the eisner (1996) algorithm can be modified to find the k-best trees while only adding an additional o(k logk) factor to the runtime (huang and chiang, 2005). 
eisner (1996b) originally used pos tags to smooth a generative model in this way.
