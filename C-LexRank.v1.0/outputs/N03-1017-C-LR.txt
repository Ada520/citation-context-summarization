we present results that compare our system against the baseline pharaoh implementation (koehn et al, 2003a) and mer training scripts provided for this workshop. 
the phrase-based decoder extracts phrases from the word alignments produced by giza++, and computes translation probabilities based on the frequency of one phrase being aligned with another (koehn et al, 2003). 
modifiers within german clauses were translated using the phrase-based model of koehn et al (2003). 
statistical phrase-based translation (koehn et al, 2003): here “phrase-based” means “subsequence-based”, as there is no guarantee that the phrases learned by the model will have any relation to what we would think of as syntactic phrases. 
as an additional baseline, we compare against a phrasal smt decoder, pharaoh (koehn et al 2003).
