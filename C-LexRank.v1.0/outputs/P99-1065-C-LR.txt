so, collins et al (1999) proposed a tag classification for parsing the czech treebank. 
constituency parsing for dependency trees a pragmatic justification for using constituencybased parsers in order to predict dependency structures is that currently the best czech dependencytree parser is a constituency-based parser (collins et al, 1999; zeman, 2004). 
to reduce sparseness, our features rely only on the reduced pos tag set from collins et al (1999). 
more precisely, parsing accuracy is measured by the attachment score, which is a standard measure used in studies of dependency parsing (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999). 
dependency fscore reached on the german negra treebank and collins et al (1999) 80.0%
