baseline pharaoh with phrases extracted from ibm model 4 training with maximum phrase length 7 and extraction method diag-growthfinal (koehn et al, 2003a) lex phrase-decoder simulation: using only the initial lexical rules from the phrase table, all with lhs x, the glue rule, and a binary reordering rule with its own reordering-feature â€¢ xcat all nonterminals merged into a single x nonterminal: simulation of the system hiero (chiang, 2005). 
during the last decade, statistical machine translation (smt) systems have evolved from the original word-based approach (brown et al, 1993) into phrase-based translation systems (koehn et al, 2003). 
the impact of constraining the joint model trained on 10,000 sentences of the german-english europarl corpora and tested with the europarl test set used in koehn et al (2003) than 10 million times that of the phrase pair with the highest count, are pruned from the phrase table. 
we generated for each phrase pair in the translation table 5 features: phrase translation probability (both directions), lexical weighting (koehn et al, 2003) (both directions) and phrase penalty (constant value). 
we present results that compare our system against the baseline pharaoh implementation (koehn et al, 2003a) and mer training scripts provided for this workshop.
