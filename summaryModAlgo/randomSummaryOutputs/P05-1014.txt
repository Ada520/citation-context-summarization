a similar idea by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005) was proposed forcapturing lexical entailment. 
previous attempts have used, for instance, the similarities between case frames (lin and pan57 tel, 2001), anchor words (barzilay and lee, 2003; shinyama et al, 2002; szepektor et al, 2004), and a web-based method (szepektor et al, 2004;geffet and dagan, 2005). 
consequently, they proposed a definition for the lexical entailment relation, which conforms to the general framework of applied textual entailment (dagan et al, 2005). 
a similar idea relying on word co-occurrence was proposed by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005)but ourmethodis simpler and we expect it to be applicable to a wider range of vocabularies.
