in response, factoid question answering systems have evolved into two types: â€¢ use-knowledge: extract query words from the input question, perform ir against the source corpus, possibly segment resulting documents, identify a set of segments containing likely answers, apply a set of heuristics that each consults a different source of knowledge to score each candidate, rank them, and select the best (harabagiu et al, 2001; hovy et al, 2001; srihari and li, 2000; abney et al, 2000). 
if the expected answer types are typical named entities, information extraction engines (bikel et al 1999, srihari and li 2000) are used to extract candidate answers.
