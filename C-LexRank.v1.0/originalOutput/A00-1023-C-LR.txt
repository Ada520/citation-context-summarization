2 question answering based on ie we use a qa system supported by increasingly sophisticated levels of ie [srihari & li 2000] [li et al 2002]. 
if the expected answer types are typical named entities, information extraction engines (bikel et al 1999, srihari and li 2000) are used to extract candidate answers. 
examples of the use of nlp and ie in question answering include shallow parsing (kupiec, 1993), semantic parsing (litkowski 1999), named entity tagging (abney et al 2000, srihari and li 1999) and high-level ie (srihari and li, 2000). 
assuming that it is very likely that the answer is a named entity, (srihari and li, 2000) describes a ne-supported q&a system that functions quite well when the expected answer type is one of the categories covered by the ne recognizer. 
typically qa is supported by natural language processing (nlp) and ie [chinchor & marsh 1998] [hovy et al 2001] [srihari & li 2000].
