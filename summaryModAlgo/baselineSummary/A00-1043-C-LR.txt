sentence simplification systems (chandrasekar et al, 1996; mahesh, 1997; carroll et al, 1998; grefenstette, 1998; jing, 2000; knight and marcu, 2000) are capable of compressing long sentences by deleting unimportant words and phrases. 
dependency structure, we cannot use complex methods for text reduction as described, e.g., in (jing, 2000). 
the evaluation of sentence reduction (see (jing, 2000) for details) used a corpus of 500 sentences and their reduced forms in human-written abstracts. 
ziff-davis corpus most previous work (jing 2000; knight and marcu 2002; riezler et al 2003; nguyen et al 2004a; turner and charniak 2005; mcdonald 2006) has relied on automatically constructed parallel corpora for training and evaluation purposes.
