for example, despite the results of neuhaus and brÂ¨oker (1997), mcdonald et al (2005b) perform parsing with arbitrary non-projective dependency structures in o(n2) time. 
an example of this for dutch is illustrated in figure 2 which was produced by the parser of mcdonald et al (2005b). 
currently, the work on conditional parsing models appears to have culminated in large margin training (taskar et al, 2003; taskar et al, 2004; tsochantaridis et al, 2004; mcdonald et al, 2005), which currently demonstrates the state of the art performance in english dependency parsing (mcdonald et al, 2005). 
notable exceptions are plaehn (2000), where discontinuous phrase structure grammar parsing is explored, and mcdonald et al (2005b), where nonprojective dependency structures are derived using spanning tree algorithms from graph theory.
