for parameter tuning, we used the 17 sentence trial set from the romanian-english corpus in the 2003 naacl task (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
mihalcea and pedersen (2003) described a shared task where the goal was to achieve the best aer. 
it was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems (dejean et al, 2003; mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
we trained and evaluated our various modifications to model 1 on data from the bilingual word alignment workshop held at hlt-naacl 2003 (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
the experiments reported here were carried out using data from the workshop on building and using parallel texts held at hlt-naacl 2003 (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003).
