ziff-davis corpus most previous work (jing 2000; knight and marcu 2002; riezler et al 2003; nguyen et al 2004a; turner and charniak 2005; mcdonald 2006) has relied on automatically constructed parallel corpora for training and evaluation purposes. 
examples include text summarisation (jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (vandeghinste and pan 2004) and information retrieval (olivers and dolan 1999). 
many algorithms exploit parallel corpora (jing 2000; knight and marcu 2002; riezler et al 2003; nguyen et al 2004a; turner and charniak 2005; mcdonald 2006) to learn the correspondences between long and short sentences in a supervised manner, typically using a rich feature space induced from parse trees.
