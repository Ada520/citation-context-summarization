additionally, some research has explored cutting and pasting segments of text from the full document to generate a summary (jing and mckeown 2000). 
5.3 related works and discussion our two-step model essentially belongs to the same category as the works of (mani et al, 1999) and (jing and mckeown, 2000). 
jing and mckeown (2000) and jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences. 
while earlier approaches for text compression were based on symbolic reduction rules (grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999), more recent approaches use an aligned corpus of documents and their human written summaries to determine which constituents can be reduced (knight and marcu 2002; jing and mckeown 2000; reizler et al 2003).
