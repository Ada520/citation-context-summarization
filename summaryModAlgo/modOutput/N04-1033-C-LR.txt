our approach to phrase-table smoothing contrasts to previous work (zens and ney, 2004) in which smoothed phrase probabilities are constructed from word-pair probabilities and combined in a log-linear model with an unsmoothed phrase-table. 
we experimented with two levels of distortion: monotonic, where the phrasal alignment is monotonic (but word reordering is still possible within a phrase) and limited distortion, where only adjacent phrases are allowed to exchange positions (zens and ney, 2004).
