subsequently, the work of (riloffand thelen, 2000) and (chaxniak et al, 2000) improved the accuracy further to 39.7% and 41%, respectively. 
refer to the readme le of minipar downloaded from http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/ lindek/minipar.htm 5 experimental results we selected the features used in quarc (riloff and thelen, 2000) to establish the reference performance level. 
keywords in questions it has been observed in the work of (riloff and thelen, 2000) that certain words in a when or where question tend to indicate that the dateline is an ~n~wer sentence to the question. 
then (riloff and thelen, 2000) and (charniak et al, 2000) reported improvements to 39.7% and 41%, respectively. 
based on these technologies, riloff and thelen (2000) improved the humsent accuracy to 40% by applying a set of heuristic rules that assign handcrafted weights to matching words and ne.
