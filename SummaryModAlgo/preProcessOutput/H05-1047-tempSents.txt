1	these axioms express knowledge that could not be derived from wordnet regarding employment9, family relations, awards, etc. 5 semantic calculus the semantic calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text . 
4	for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in , achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and , which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
7	attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding and the addition of semantic axioms . 
2	the two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms”as in moldovan et al but not raina et al . 
3	many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form . 
6	our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in , and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%. 
5	in id 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of the text, to 1this is the same problem labeled and addressed as context in tatu and moldovan .
