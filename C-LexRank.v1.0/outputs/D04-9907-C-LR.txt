szpektor et al (2004) automatically identify anchors in web corpus data. 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2003), and other relations. 
the tease algorithm (szpektor et al, 2004) is an unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the web for a given input template. 
szpektor et al (2004) applies a similar, with no seed lists, to extract automatically entailment relationships between verbs, and etzioni et al (2005) report very good results extracting named entities and relationships from the web. 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2006), and other relations.
