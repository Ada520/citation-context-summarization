(bilexical models were also proposed by eisner (eisner, 1996)). 
and, in fact, it is possible to devise o(n 3) parsers for this formalism (lombardo, lesmo 1996), or other projective variations (milward 1994) (eisner 1996). 
eisner (1996b) originally used pos tags to smooth a generative model in this way. 
this is true of the widely used link grammar parser for english (sleator and temperley, 1993), which uses a dependency grammar of sorts, the probabilistic dependency parser of eisner (1996), and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers (yamada and matsumoto, 2003; nivre et al, 2004). 
a major difference between our approach and most other models tested on the wsj is that the dop model uses frontier lexicalization while most other models use constituent lexicalization (in that they associate each constituent non terminal with its lexical head -see collins 1996, 1999; charniak 1997; eisner 1997).
