in addition, we replace mbl with svm, a learning algorithm that tends to give higher accuracy in classifier-based parsing although it is more 6more precisely, we use the variant called path in nivre and nilsson (2005). 
as a general result, our experiments confirm previous studies on non-projective dependency parsing (nivre and nilsson, 2005; hall and novák, 2005; 512 mcdonald and pereira, 2006): the phenomenon of non-projectivity cannot be ignored without also ignoring a significant portion of real-world data (around 15a37for ddt, and 23a37for pdt). 
the following treebanks were used for training the parser: (afonso et al, 2002; atalay et al, 2003; böhmovà et al, 2003; brants et al, 2002; chen et al, 2003; civit torruella and martì antonìn, 2002; džeroski et al, 2006; hajiç et al, 2004; kawata and bartels, 2000; kromann, 2003; nilsson et al, 2005; oflazer et al, 2003; simov et al, 2005; van der beek et al, 2002).
