these axioms express knowledge that could not be derived from wordnet regarding employment9, family relations, awards, etc. 5 semantic calculus the semantic calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text (tatu and moldovan, 2005). 
the two models become distinct when there is a good supply of additional linguistic and world knowledge axioms”as in moldovan et al (2003) but not raina et al (2005). 
many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (bayer et al, 2005; bos and markert, 2005; raina et al, 2005; tatu and moldovan, 2005). 
for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (bos and markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
in id 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of the text, to 1this is the same problem labeled and addressed as context in tatu and moldovan (2005). 
our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%. 
attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding (bos and markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms (tatu and moldovan, 2005).
