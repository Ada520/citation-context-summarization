michael collins (1996, 1997, 1999) parsing models have been quite influential in the field of natural language processing. 
some of the more popular and more accurate of these approaches to data-driven parsing (charniak, 2000; collins, 1997; klein and manning, 2002) have been based on generative models that are closely related to probabilistic context-free grammars. 
collins et al (1999) applied the parser of collins (1997) developed for english, to czech, and found thatthe performance was substantially lower when compared to the results for english. 
mainstream approaches in statistical parsing are based on nondeterministic parsing techniques, usually employing some kind of dynamic programming, in combination with generative probabilistic models that provide an n-best ranking of the set of candidate analyses derived by the parser (collins, 1997; collins, 1999; charniak, 2000).
