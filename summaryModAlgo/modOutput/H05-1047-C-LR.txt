in id 152, we would like the hypothesis to align with the first part of the text, to 1this is the same problem labeled and addressed as context in tatu and moldovan (2005). 
our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%. 
attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding (bos and markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms (tatu and moldovan, 2005).
