word alignment is an important component of a complete statistical machine translation pipeline (koehn et al, 2003). 
on smaller data sets (koehn et al, 2003) the joint model shows performance comparable to the standard model, however the joint model does not reach the level of performance of the stan156 en-es es-en joint 3-gram, dl4 20.51 26.64 5-gram, dl6 26.34 27.17 + lex. 
in an experimental evaluation on the test-set that was used in koehn et al (2003) we show that for examples that are in coverage of the grammar-based system, we can achieve stateof-the-art quality on n-gram based evaluation measures.
