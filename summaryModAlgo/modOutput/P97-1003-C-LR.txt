many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [black, 1992] [briscoe, 1993] [charniak, 1997] [collins, 1996] [collins, 1997] [magerman, 1995] [eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively. 
previous work the generative models described in collins (1996) and the earlier version of these models described in collins (1997) conditioned on punctuation as surface features of the string, treating it quite differently from lexical items. 
previous parsing models (e.g., collins, 1997; charniak, 2000) maximize the joint probability p(s, t) of a sentence s and its parse tree t. we maximize the conditional probability p(t | s).
