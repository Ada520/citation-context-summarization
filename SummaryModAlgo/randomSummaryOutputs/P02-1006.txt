in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is mostly used (ravichandran and hovy, 2002):/
hearst (1992) was the first followed by recent larger-scale and more fully automated efforts (pantel and ravichandran 2004; etzioni et al 2004; ravichandran and hovy 2002). 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns.
