defining scms the work presented here was done in the context of phrase-based mt (koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004). 
(och and ney, 2004) defines the notion of consistency for the set of phrasal translations that are learned from wordfigure 3: following the definition in eq. 
the phrase learning approach in (och and ney, 2004) takes two alignments: a source-to-target alignment a180 a10 and a target-to-source alignment a180 a178 . 
the decoding algorithm shown here is most similar to the decoding algorithms presented in (koehn, 2004) and (och and ney, 2004), the later being used for the alignment template model for smt. 
a common approach to phrase-based smt is to learn phrasal translation pairs from word-aligned training data (och and ney, 2004). 
nonetheless, attempts to incorporate richer linguistic features have generally met with little success (och et al, 2004a). 
unfortunately, recent work has shown that applying statistical parsers to ungrammatical mt output is unreliable at best, with the parser often assigning unreasonable probabilities and incongruent structure (yamada and knight, 2002; och et al, 2004a). 
first, we describe the addition of two new features to the chinese model, in a manner similar to that of och et al (2004b); then we describe how we scaled the system up to a much larger training set. 
for algorithms whose packed representations are graphs, such as hidden markov models and other nitestate methods, ratnaparkhi’s mxparse parser (ratnaparkhi, 1997), and many stack-based machine translation decoders (brown et al, 1995; och and ney, 2004), the k-best paths problem is well-studied in both pure algorithmic context (see (eppstein, 2001) and (brander and sinclair, 1995) for surveys) and nlp/speech community (mohri, 2002; mohri and riley, 2002). 
a detailed analysis will be given for two of them; the so-called alignment template system (och and ney, 2004), (denoted as at in the tables) and the phrase-based translation system described in section 2.2 (denoted as pbt in the tables). 
nowadays, most of the state-of-the-art smt systems are based on bilingual phrases (bertoldi et al, 2004; koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004; tillmann, 2003; vogel et al, 2004; zens and ney, 2004). 
phrase-based statistical machine translation (smt) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (och and ney, 2004). 
phrase pairs are extracted by following the method described in (och and ney, 2004) where all contiguous phrase pairs having consistent alignments are extraction candidates. 
an empirical evaluation against a state-of-the-art smt system similar to (och and ney, 2004) indicates positive prospects. 
anotherpromisingprospectofourmodelseems to lie in its ability to handle non-contiguous phrases, a feature that state of the art systems such as (och and ney, 2004) do not incorporate. 
we compare our syntax-based system against an implementation of the alignment template (altemp) approach to mt (och and ney, 2004), which is widely considered to represent the state of the art in the field. 
we obtain the word alignments using the method of koehn et al (2003), which is based on that of och and ney (2004). 
the alignment template translation model (och and ney, 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the previous state of the art by moving from words to phrases as the basic unit of translation. 
a lexicalized phrase-reordering model like that in use in isi's system (och et al, 2004) might be able to learn a better reordering, but simpler distortion models will probably not. 
to do this, we first identify initial phrase pairs using the same criterion as previous systems (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003): definition 1. 
above the phrase level, these models typically have a simple distortion model that reorders phrases independently of their content (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003), or not at all (zens and ney, 2004; kumar et al, 2005). 
the problem of coverage in smt statistical machine translation made considerable advances in translation quality with the introduction of phrase-based translation (marcu and wong, 2002; koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004). 
limitations of basic word-based models prompted researchers to exploit morphological and/or syntactic/phrasal structure (niessen and ney, (2004), lee,(2004), yamada and knight (2001), marcu and wong (2002), och and ney (2004),koehn et al (2003), among others.) 
we also compare the top result of our synchronous binarization system with the state-of-theart alignment-template approach (ats) (och and ney, 2004). 
the current state of the art is represented by the so-called phrase-based translation approach (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003). 
phrase-based models (koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004) are good at learning local translations that are pairs of (consecutive) sub-strings, but often insufficient in modeling the reorderings of phrases themselves, especially between language pairs with very different word-order. 
translation including the joint probability phrasebased model (marcu and wong, 2002) and a variant on the alignment template approach (och and ney, 2004), and contrast them to the performance of the word-based ibm model 4 (brown et al, 1993). 
different models have been presented in the literature, see for instance (brown et al, 1993; och and ney, 2004; vidal et al, 1993; vogel et al, 1996). 
an aligned phrase pair is consistent with the word alignment if neither phrase contains any word aligning to a word outside the other phrase (och and ney, 2004). 
obviously, the npa is a special case of the phrase extractor in (och and ney, 2004) in that it considers only one phrase alignment rather than all possible ones. 
phrase-based statistical machine translation (smt) systems analyze large quantities of bilingual parallel texts in order to learn translational alignments between pairs of words and phrases in two languages (och and ney, 2004). 
phrase pairs are extracted by following the method described in (och and ney, 2004) where all contiguous phrase pairs having consistent alignments are extraction candidates. 
baseline mt system: alignment templates our baseline mt system is the alignment template system described in detail by och, tillmann, and ney (1999) and och and ney (2004). 
in view of content-independency of the distortion and flat reordering models, several researchers (och et al, 2004; tillmann, 2004; kumar et al, 2005; koehn et al, 2005) proposed a more powerful model called lexicalized reordering model that is phrase dependent. 
one is distortion model (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003) which penalizes translations according to their jump distance instead of their content. 
among these models, the basic ones are a translation model pr(e|f) and a target language model pr(e), which can be complemented by reordering models (if the language pairs presents very long alignments in training), word penalty to avoid favoring short sentences, class-based target-language models, etc (och and ney, 2004). 
synchronous binarization for mt machine translation has made very good progress in recent times, especially, the so-called “phrasebased” statistical systems (och and ney, 2004). 
recent work in statistical machine translation (mt) has sought to overcome the limitations of phrasebased models (marcu and wong, 2002; koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004) by making use of syntactic information. 
here we refer to bilingual phrase (bp) as the bilingual phrases used by och and ney (2004). 
most current smt systems (och and ney, 2004; koehn et al, 2003) use a generative model for word alignment such as the freely available giza++ (och and ney, 2003), an implementation of the ibm alignment models (brown et al, 1993). 
the phrase-based-like submodels have been proved useful in phrase-based approaches to smt (och and ney, 2004). 
the spmt models outperform a state of the art phrase-based baseline model by 2.64 bleu points on the nist 2003 chinese-english test corpus and 0.28 points on a humanbased quality metric that ranks translations on a scale from 1 to 5. 1 introduction during the last four years, various implementations and extentions to phrase-based statistical models (marcu and wong, 2002; koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004) have led to significant increases in machine translation accuracy. 
words of parallel chinese-english data released by ldc, in order to train several statistical-based mt systems: pbmt, a strong state of the art phrase-based system that implements the alignment template model (och and ney, 2004); this is the system isi has used in the 2004 and 2005 nist evaluations. 
language models (och and ney, 2004; tillman, 2004), are too weak to help a phrase-based decoder reorder the target phrases into grammatical outputs. 
given a sentence pair and a corresponding word alignment, phrases are extracted following the criterion in och and ney (2004). 
standard phrase-based translation systems use a word distance-based reordering model in which non-monotonic phrase alignment is penalized based on the word distance between successively translated source phrases without considering the orientation of the phrase alignment or the identities of the source and target phrases (koehn et al, 2003; och and ney, 2004). 
first, many-to-many word alignments are induced by running a one-to-many word alignment model, such as giza++ (och and ney, 2003), in both directions and by combining the results based on a heuristic (och and ney, 2004). 
in addition, we added three feature functions to restrict reorderings and to represent globalized insertion/deletion of words: • lexicalized reordering feature function scores whether a phrase translation pair is monotonically translated or not (och et al, 2004): hlex(¯ak1 | ¯f k1 , ¯ek1 ) = log kproductdisplay k=1 pr(δk| ¯f¯ak, ¯ek) (3) where δk = 1 iff ¯ak − ¯ak−1 = 1 otherwise δk = 0. 
unless otherwise noted, the following discussion is generally applicable to alignment template systems (och and ney 2004) as well.
