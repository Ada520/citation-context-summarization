in an attempt to extend a constituency-based parsing model to train on dependency trees, collins transforms the pdt dependency trees into constituency trees (collins et al, 1999). 
47 feature type id description form f the fully inflected word form as it appears in the data lemma l the morphologically reduced lemma mtag t a subset of the morphological tag as described in (collins et al, 1999) pos p major part-of-speech tag (first field of the morphological tag) parsergov g true if candidate was proposed as governor by parser childcount c the number of children agreement a(x,y) check for case/number agreement between word x and y table 2: description of the classes of features used in all models, we include features containing the form, the lemma, the morphological tag, and the parsergov feature. 
more specifically for pdt, collins et al (1999) relabel coordinated phrases after converting dependency structures to phrase structures, and zeman (2004) uses a kind of pattern matching, based on frequencies of the parts-of-speech of conjuncts and conjunctions. 
czech results for the czech data, we used the predefined training, development and testing split of the prague dependency treebank (hajiË‡c et al, 2001), and the automatically generated pos tags supplied with the data, which we reduce to the pos tag set from collins et al (1999). 
this is well illustrated by the collins parser (collins, 1997; collins, 1999), scrutinized by bikel (2004), where several transformations are applied in order to improve the analysis of noun phrases, coordination and punctuation.
