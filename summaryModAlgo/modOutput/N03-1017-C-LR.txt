the block set is generated using a phrase-pair selection algorithm similar to (koehn et al, 2003; al-onaizan et al, 2004), which includes some heuristic filtering to mal statement here. 
on smaller data sets (koehn et al, 2003) the joint model shows performance comparable to the standard model, however the joint model does not reach the level of performance of the stan156 en-es es-en joint 3-gram, dl4 20.51 26.64 5-gram, dl6 26.34 27.17 + lex. 
limitations of basic word-based models prompted researchers to exploit morphological and/or syntactic/phrasal structure (niessen and ney, (2004), lee,(2004), yamada and knight (2001), marcu and wong (2002), och and ney (2004),koehn et al (2003), among others.)
