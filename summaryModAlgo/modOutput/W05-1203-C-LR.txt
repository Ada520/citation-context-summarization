in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dectors: the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivationally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in wordnet, and, finally, a wordnet-based similarity (jiang and conrath, 1997). 
a first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between t and h either assuming the independence between words (corley and mihalcea, 2005; glickman et al, 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (kouylekov and magnini, 2005). 
our approach is in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005; glickman et al, 2005)).
