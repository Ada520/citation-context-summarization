in the hierarchical phrase-based model, production rules are accumulated by computing “holes” for extracted contiguous phrases (chiang, 2005)
besides, our model, as being linguistically motivated, is also more expressive than the formally syntax-based models of chiang (2005) and wu (1997). 
variations of scfgs go back to aho and ullman (1972)'s syntax-directed translation schemata, but also include the inversion transduction grammars in wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the multitext grammars in melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as yamada and knight (2001) and galley et al (2004). 
from this point, our decoder is similar to the work by chiang (2005). 
hierarchical phrases recent work in the use of hierarchical phrases (chiang 2005) improves the ability to capture linguistic generalizations, and also removes the limitation to contiguous phrases.
