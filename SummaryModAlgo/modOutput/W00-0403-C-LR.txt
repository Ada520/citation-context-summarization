the first of these, relative utility (ru) (radev et al, 2000) allows model summaries to consist of sentences with variable ranking. 
the mead summarizer the mead summarizer [radev et al, 2000] [radev et al 2002] is based on sentence extraction and uses a linear combination of three features to rank the sentences in the source documents. 
a common approach is to measure similarity between all pairs of sentences and then use clustering to identify themes of common information (mckeown et al 1999; radev, jing, and budzikowska 2000; marcu and gerber 2001). 
mead (radev et al, 2000): mead is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence. 
a number of techniques for choosing the right sentences to extract have been proposed in the literature, ranging from word counts (luhn, 1958), key phrases (edmundson, 1969), naive bayesian classification (kupiec et al, 1995), lexical chains (barzilay and elhadad, 1997), topic signatures (hovy and lin, 1999) and cluster centroids (radev et al, 2000).
