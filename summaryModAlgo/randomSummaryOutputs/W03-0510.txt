these findings are additionally supported by the fact that automatic n-gram-based evaluation measures now being used to assess predominately extractive multi-document summarization systems correlate strongly with human judgments when restricted to the usage of unigrams and bigrams, but correlate weakly when longer n-grams are factored into the equation (lin & hovy, 2003). 
another recent study (lin and hovy, 2003) investigated the extent to which extractive methods may be sufficient for summarization in the single-document case. 
meta-evaluation of similarity metrics the question of how to know which similarity metric is best to evaluate automatic summaries/translations has been addressed by â€¢ comparing the quality of automatic items with the quality of manual references (culy and riehemann, 2003; lin and hovy, 2003b).
