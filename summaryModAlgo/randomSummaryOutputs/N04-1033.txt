recently, various works have improved the quality of statistical machine translation systems by using phrase translation (koehn et al, 2003; marcu et al, 2002; och et al, 1999; och and ney, 2000; zens et al, 2004). 
more details about the baseline system can be found in (zens and ney, 2004; zens et al, 2005). 
for the confidence measures which will be introduced in section 5, we use a state-of-the-art phrasebased approach as described in (zens and ney, 2004). 
several strategies to compute these probabilities have been proposed (zens et al, 2004; crego et al, 2004), but none of them takes into account the fact that, when it comes to translation, many different inflected forms of words share the same translation.
