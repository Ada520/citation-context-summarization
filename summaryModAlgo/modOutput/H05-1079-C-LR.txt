(bos and markert, 2005) represents a1 and a0 into a first-order logic translation of the drs language used in discourse representation theory (kamp and reyle, 1993) and uses a theorem prover and a model builder with some generic, lexical and geographical background knowledge to prove the entailment between the two texts. 
these transformations are logical rules in (bos and markert, 2005) or sequences of allowed rewrite rules in (de salvo braz et al, 2005). 
we show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (jijkoun and de rijke, 2005), graph alignment (haghighi et al, 2005), weighted abduction (raina et al, 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (bos and markert, 2005).
