next, we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web (szpektor et al, 2004), the minipar dependency parser (lin, 1998) and a syntactic matching module. 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2006), and other relations. 
the task of verb entailment acquisition appears to have much in common with that of paraphrase acquisition (lin and pantel, 2001), (pang et al, 2003), (szpektor et al, 2004). 
the tease algorithm (szpektor et al, 2004) is an unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the web for a given input template. 
szpektor et al (2004) automatically identify anchors in web corpus data. 
szpektor et al (2004) applies a similar, with no seed lists, to extract automatically entailment relationships between verbs, and etzioni et al (2005) report very good results extracting named entities and relationships from the web. 
such transformations are typically denoted as paraphrases in the literature, where a wealth of methods for their automatic acquisition were proposed (lin and pantel, 2001; shinyama et al, 2002; barzilay and lee, 2003; szpektor et al, 2004). 
we then incorporate paraphrase similarity within the lexical similarity model by allowing, for some unaligned node h ‚àà ph, where t ‚àà pt: sim(h,t) = max(mn(h,t),score(ph,pt)) 38 our approach to paraphrase detection is most similar to the te/ase algorithm (szpektor et al, 2004), and bears similarity to both dirt (lin and pantel, 2001) and knowitall (etzioni et al, 2004). 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2003), and other relations. 
taking a stepfurther, the tease algorithm (szpektoretal., 2004) provides a completely unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the web for a given input relation (see section 5.1). 
these retrieved text fragments are then considered good candidate for paraphrasing x bought y. anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (ravichandran and hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (szpektor et al, 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented. 
szpektor et al (2004) measured yieldù, the number of correct rules learned for an input re1see the 3rd iwp workshop for a sample of recent works on paraphrasing (http://nlp.nagaokaut.ac.jp/iwp2005/).
