dependency-based statistical language modeling and analysis have also become quite popular in statistical natural language processing (lafferty et al, 1992; eisner, 1996; chelba and et al, 1997). 
in english as well as in japanese, dependency analysis has been studied (e.g., (lafferty et al, 1992; collins, 1996; eisner, 1996)).

eisner (1996b) originally used pos tags to smooth a generative model in this way. 
eisner (1996a, 1996b) describes several dependency-based models that are also closely related to the models in this article. 
of particular relevance is other work on parsing the penn wsj treebank (jelinek et al 1994; magerman 1995; eisner 1996a, 1996b; collins 1996; charniak 1997; goodman 1997; ratnaparkhi 1997; chelba and jelinek 1998; roark 2001). 
beginning with the seminal work at ibm (black et al, 1991; black et al, 1992b; black et al, 1992a), and continuing with such lexicalist approaches as (eisner, 1996), these features have been lauded for their ability to approximate a word's semantics as a means to override syntactic preferences with semantic ones (collins, 1999; eisner, 2000). 
eisner (1996), charniak (1997), collins (1997), and many subsequent researchers1 annotated every node with lexical features passed up from its head childù in order to more precisely reflect the node's sideù contents. 
this approach is one of those described in eisner (1996). 
another use of bottom-up is due to eisner (1996), who introduced the notion of a span 
a generative one (eisner, 1996; dreyer et al, 2006), or train a machine learner to predict those. 
if the parse has to be projective, eisner's bottom-up-span algorithm (eisner, 1996) can be used for the search. 
eisner (1996) introduced a data-driven dependency parser and compared several probability models on (english) penn treebank data. 
bilexical statistics (eisner 1996), as represented by the maximal context of the p l w and p r w parameters, serve as a proxy for such semantic preferences, where the actual modifier word (as opposed to, say, merely its part of speech) indicates the particular semantics of its head. 
see for example (lombardi, 1996; eisner, 1996), who also discuss early-style parsers for projective dependency grammars. 
(bilexical models were also proposed by eisner (eisner, 1996)). 
we re-implemented eisner's decoder (eisner, 1996), which searches among all projective parse trees, and the chu-liu-edmonds decoder (chu and liu, 1965; edmonds, 1967), which searches in the space of both projective and non-projective parses. 
in many dependency parsing models such as (eisner, 1996) and (macdonald et al, 2005), the score of a dependency tree is the sum of the scores of the dependency links, which are computed independently of other links. 
eisner (eisner, 1996) proposed an o(n 3) parsing algorithm for pdg. 
probabilistic parsing, which either attempts to learn to predict gr~rarn~tical structure of test data directly from a training treebank (brill, 1993; collins, 1996; eisner, 1996; jelinek et al, 1994; magerman, 1995; s~kine and orishman, 1995; sharman et al, 1990), or employs a grammar and sometimes a dictionary to capture linguistic expertise directly (black et al, 1993a; grinberg et al, 1995; schabes; 1992), but arguably at a less detailed and informative level than in the research reported here. 
unlabeled attachment score (uas): the proportion of words that are assigned the correct head (or no head if the word is a root) (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999). 
previous works on statistical dependency analysis include fujio and matsumoto (1998) and haruno et al (1998) in japanese analysis as well as lafferty et al (1992), eisner (1996), and collins (1996) in english analysis. 
to find the optimal parse given the weight vector w and feature vector f(i, j) we use the decoder described in (eisner, 1996). 
first, in supervised models, a head out-ward process is modeled (eisner, 1996; collins, 1999). 
eisner (1996) gave a generative model with a cubic parsing algorithm based on an edge factorization of trees. 
we follow the edge based factorization method of eisner (1996) and define the score of a dependency tree as the sum of the score of all edges in the tree, s(x,y) = summationdisplay (i,j)‚àày s(i,j) = summationdisplay (i,j)‚àày w ¬∑ f(i,j) where f(i,j) is a high-dimensional binary feature representation of the edge from xi to xj. 
yet, they can be parsed in o(n3) time (eisner, 1996). 
the eisner (1996) algorithm can be modified to find the k-best trees while only adding an additional o(k logk) factor to the runtime (huang and chiang, 2005). 
figure 2: o(n3) algorithm of eisner (1996), needs to keep 3 indices at any given stage. 
we present an effective training algorithm for linearly-scored dependency parsers that implements online large-margin multi-class training (crammer and singer, 2003; crammer et al, 2003) on top of efficient parsing techniques for dependency trees (eisner, 1996). 
eisner (1996) made the observation that if the head of each chart item is on the left or right periphery, then it is possible to parse in o(n3). 
in particular, we follow (eisner, 1996; eisner and satta, 1999; mcdonald et al, 2005) and assume that the score of a complete spanning tree a19 for a given sentence, whether probabilistically motivated or not, can be decomposed as a sum of local scores for each link (a word pair). 
if projectivity (no crossing branches) is desired, eisner's (1996) dynamic programming algorithm (similar to cyk) for dependency parsing can be used instead. 
2 dependency reparsing in dependency reparsing we focus on unlabeled dependencies, as described by eisner (1996). 
unlike the deterministic parsers above, this parser uses a dynamic programming algorithm (eisner, 1996) to determine the best tree, so there is no difference between presenting the input from left-to-right or right-to-left. 
and, in fact, it is possible to devise o(n 3) parsers for this formalism (lombardo, lesmo 1996), or other projective variations (milward 1994) (eisner 1996). 
also, a number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (covington 1990) (kwon, yoon 1991) (sleator, temperley 1993) (hahn et al 1994) (lombardo, lesmo 1996), including a stochastic treatment (eisner 1996) and an object-oriented parallel parsing method (neuhaus, hahn 1996). 
more precisely, parsing accuracy is measured by the attachment score, which is a standard measure used in studies of dependency parsing (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999). 
however, since most previous studies instead use the mean attachment score per word (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999), we will give this measure as well. 
unlike most previous work on data-driven dependency parsing (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999; yamada and matsumoto, 2003; nivre, 2003), we assume that dependency graphs are labeled with dependency types, although the evaluation will give results for both labeled and unlabeled representations. 
dependency structures are more efficient to parse (eisner, 1996) and are believed to be easier to learn, yet they still capture much of the predicate-argument information needed in applications (haghighi et al, 2005), which is one reason for the recent interest in learning these structures (eisner, 1996; mcdonald et al, 2005; yamada and matsumoto, 2003; nivre and scholz, 2004). 
in the context of dps, this edge based factorization method was proposed by (eisner, 1996). 
3 the probability model the dag-like nature of the dependency structures makes it difficult to apply generative modelling techniques (abney, 1997; johnson et al, 1999), so we have defined a conditional model, similar to the model of collins (1996) (see also the conditional model in eisner (1996b)). 
a non-projective example from the czech prague dependency treebank (hajiÀác et al, 2001) is also shown in figure 2. most previous dependency parsing models have focused on projective trees, including the work of eisner (1996), collins et al (1999), yamada and matsumoto (2003), nivre and scholz (2004), and mcdonald et al (2005). 
we address this concern in section 4. 2.2.2 projective trees it is well known that projective dependency parsing using edge based factorization can be handled with the eisner algorithm (eisner, 1996). 
using this representation, the parsing algorithm of eisner (1996) is sufficient for search ing over all projective trees in o(n3) time. 
this al-gorithm has a runtime of o(n3) and has been employed successfully in both generative and discriminative parsing models (eisner, 1996; mcdonald et al, 2005). 
this formalization generalizes standard projective parsing models based on the eisner algorithm (eisner, 1996) to yield efficient o(n2) exact parsing methods for nonprojective languages like czech. 
context-free rules charniak (1996) collins (1996), eisner (1996) context-free rules, headwords charniak (1997) context-free rules, headwords, grandparent nodes collins (2000) context-free rules, headwords, grandparent nodes/rules, bigrams, two-level rules, two-level bigrams, nonheadwords bod (1992) all fragments within parse trees scope of statistical dependencies model figure 4. schematic overview of the increase of statistical dependencies by stochastic parsers thus there seems to be a convergence towards a maximalist model which "takes all fragments [...] and lets the statistics decide" (bod 1998: 5). 
a major difference between our approach and most other models tested on the wsj is that the dop model uses frontier lexicalization while most other models use constituent lexicalization (in that they associate each constituent non terminal with its lexical head -see collins 1996, 1999; charniak 1997; eisner 1997). 
collins 1996; eisner 1996), later models showed the importance of including context from higher nodes in the tree (charniak 1997; johnson 1998). 
at both training and run time, edges are scored independently, and eisner's o(n3) decoder (eisner, 1996) is used to find the optimal parse. 
a similar modification was used by eisner (1996) for the study of dependency parsing models. 
this is true of the widely used link grammar parser for english (sleator and temperley, 1993), which uses a dependency grammar of sorts, the probabilistic dependency parser of eisner (1996), and more recently proposed deterministic dependency parsers (yamada and matsumoto, 2003; nivre et al, 2004). 
our system is a bottom-up projective dependency parser, based on the cubic-time algorithm by eisner (1996; 2000). 
we use the cubic-time algorithm for dependency parsing proposed by eisner (1996; 2000). 
a similar measure precision recall broadcast 93.4 % 88.0 % literature 96.0 % 88.6 % newspaper 95.3 % 87.9 % figure 7: percentages of heads correctly attached broadcast precision recall n subjects 95 % 89 % 244 objects 89 % 83 % 140 predicatives 96 % 86 % 57 literature precision recall n subjects 98 % 92 % 195 objects 94 % 91% 118 predicatives 97 % 93 % 72 newspaper precision recall n subjects 95 % 83 % 136 objects 94 % 88 % 103 predicatives 92 % 96 % 23 figure 8: rates for main functional dependencies is used in (eisner, 1996) except that every word has a head, i.e. 
this kind of restriction is present in many dependency-based parsing systems (mccord, 1990; sleator and temperley, 1991; eisner, 1996). 
the projectivity constraint also leads to favourable parsing complexities: chart-based parsing of projective dependency grammars can be done in cubic time (eisner, 1996); hard-wiring projectivity into a deterministic dependency parser leads to linear-time parsing in the worst case (nivre, 2003). 
many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [black, 1992] [briscoe, 1993] [charniak, 1997] [collins, 1996] [collins, 1997] [magerman, 1995] [eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively. 
in the field of statistical parsing, various probabilistic evaluation models have been proposed where different models use different feature types [black, 1992] [briscoe, 1993] [brown, 1991] [charniak, 1997] [collins, 1996] [collins, 1997] [magerman, 1991] [magerman, 1992] [magerman, 1995] [eisner, 1996]. 
from the models proposed in (eisner, 1996), we retain only the model referred to as model c in this work, since the best results were obtained with it. 
the proposed model was used to assign probability estimates to dependency links between nuclei in our own implementation of the parser described in (eisner, 1996). 
this extension could be used in our case too, but, since the input to our processing chain consists of tagged words (unless the input of the stochastic dependency parser of (eisner, 1996)), we do not think it necessary. 
for more details concerning the parser, see (eisner, 1996).
