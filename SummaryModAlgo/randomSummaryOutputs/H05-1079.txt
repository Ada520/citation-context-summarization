for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (bos and markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
we show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (jijkoun and de rijke, 2005), graph alignment (haghighi et al, 2005), weighted abduction (raina et al, 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (bos and markert, 2005). 
attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including modelbuilding (bos and markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms (tatu and moldovan, 2005). 
many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (bayer et al, 2005; bos and markert, 2005; raina et al, 2005; tatu and moldovan, 2005).
