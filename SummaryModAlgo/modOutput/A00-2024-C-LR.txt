while this approach exploits only syntactic and lexical information, jing and mckeown (2000) also rely on cohesion information, derived from word distribution in a text: phrases that are linked to a local context are retained, while phrases that have no such links are dropped. 
our work in sentence reformulation is different from cut-and-paste summarization (jing and mckeown 2000) in many ways. 
because of this, it is generally accepted that some kind of postprocessing should be performed to improve the final result, by shortening, fusing, or otherwise revising the material (grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; jing and mckeown 2000; barzilay et al 2000; knight and marcu 2000). 
as previously observed in the literature (mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; jing and mckeown 2000), such components include a clause in the clause conjunction, relative clauses, and some elements within a clause (such as adverbs and prepositions). 
we found that the deletion of lead parts did not occur very often in our summary, unlike the case of jing and mckeown (2000).
