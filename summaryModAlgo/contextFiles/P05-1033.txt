synchronous context-free grammars several definitions for synchronous context-free grammars have been proposed in the literature; see for instance (chiang, 2004; chiang, 2005). 
the compositional bi-phrase feature function hcomp: this is introduced to compensate for 1 recent work from chiang (chiang, 2005) addresses similar concerns to those motivating our work by introducing a synchronous cfg for bi-phrases. 
in the future, we plan to explore our discriminative framework on a full distortion model (koehn et al, 2003) or even a hierarchical model (chiang, 2005). 
another example of this framework is the hierarchical model of chiang (2005). 
the first approach is to reuse the components of a generative model, but tune their relative weights in a discriminative fashion (och and ney, 2002; och, 2003; chiang, 2005). 
1a notable exception to this kind of approach is chiang (2005) who introduces syntactic information into phrase-based smt via hierarchical phrases rather than by external parsing. 
chiang (2005) introduces hiero, a hierarchical phrase-based model for statistical machine translation. 
chiang (2005) reported significant performance improvements in chinese-english translation as compared with pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based system (koehn, 2004). 
in this paper, we discuss a new hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system (chiang, 2005), presenting recent extensions to the original proposal, new evaluation results in a community-wide evaluation, and a novel technique for fine-grained comparative analysis of mt systems. 
3.2 scaling up training chiang (2005) reports on experiments in chineseenglish translation using a model trained on 7.2m+9.2m 
the work reported in this paper extends the original treatment of hiero (chiang, 2005) by evaluating an improved version in a community-wide exercise for chinese-english and arabic-english translation, and by introducing a novel analysis technique for comparing mt systems’ output. 
we also implemented algorithms 2 and 3 in a parsing-based mt decoder (chiang, 2005) and report results on decoding speed. 
similarly, chiang (2005) uses the k-best parsing algorithm described below in a cfg-based log-linear translation model in order to learn feature weights which maximize bleu. 
mt decoder our second experiment was on a cky-based decoder for a machine translation system (chiang, 2005), implemented in python 2.4 accelerated with psyco 1.3 (rigo, 2004). 
we have presented here a general-purpose algorithm for k-best parsing and applied it to two state-of-the-art, large-scale nlp systems: bikel’s implementation of collins lexicalized pcfg model (bikel, 2004; collins, 2003) and chiang’s synchronous cfg based decoder (chiang, 2005) for machine translation. 
in our experiments, we apply the algorithms to the lexicalized pcfg parser of bikel (2004), which is very similar to collins’ model 2 (collins, 2003), and to a synchronous cfg based machine translation system (chiang, 2005). 
synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models (melamed, 2004; chiang, 2005). 
complete mrs are then formed by combining these nl substrings and their translations under a parsing framework called the synchronous cfg (aho and ullman, 1972), which forms the basis of most existing statistical syntax-based translation models (yamada and knight, 2001; chiang, 2005). 
while the state-of-the-art hierarchical smt system (chiang, 2005) performs well despite stringent constraints imposed on its context-free grammar, we believe its main advantage lies in its ability to extract hierarchical rules across phrasal boundaries. 
similarly to (poutsma, 2000; wu, 1997; yamada and knight, 2001; chiang, 2005), the rules discussed in this paper are equivalent to productions of synchronous tree substitution grammars. 
we believe it will be beneficial to account for this finding in future work in syntax-based smt and in efforts to improve upon (chiang, 2005). 
(chiang, 2005) generates synchronous context-free grammar (syncfg) rules from an existing phrase translation table. 
baseline pharaoh with phrases extracted from ibm model 4 training with maximum phrase length 7 and extraction method ‘diag-growthfinal’ (koehn et al, 2003a) • lex phrase-decoder simulation: using only the initial lexical rules from the phrase table, all with lhs x, the glue rule, and a binary reordering rule with its own reordering-feature • xcat all nonterminals merged into a single x nonterminal: simulation of the system hiero (chiang, 2005). 
recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (brown et al, 1993) and phrase based (koehn et al, 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (melamed, 2004). 
therefore, after annotating the initial rules from the current training sentence pair, we adhere to (chiang, 2005) to recursively generalize each existing rule; however, we abstract on a per-sentence basis. 
while (chiang, 2005) uses only two nonterminal symbols in his grammar, we introduce multiple syntactic categories, taking advantage of a target language parser for this information. 
pos-based features, syntactic or hierarchical features (chiang, 2005). 
while error-driven training techniques are commonly used to improve the performance of phrasebased translation systems (chiang, 2005; och, 2003), this paper presents a novel block sequence translation approach to smt that is similar to sequential natural language annotation problems 727 such as part-of-speech tagging or shallow parsing, both in modeling and parameter training. 
clearly the bleu scores are quite low; we are planning to perform experiments on arabic using a more advanced translation system, such as hiero (chiang, 2005). 
to find such groups of morphemes and functional words, we applied a sequence of morpheme groupings by extracting frequently occuring n-grams of morphemes as follows (much like the grouping used by chiang (2005): in a series of iterations, we obtained high-frequency bigrams from the morphemic representation of parallel texts, of either morphemes, or of previously such identified morpheme groups and neighboring morphemes until up to four morphemes or one root 3 morpheme could be combined. 
several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (chiang, 2005; galley et al, 2004) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers. 
one way around this difficulty is to stipulate that all rules must be binary from the outset, as in inversion-transduction grammar (itg) (wu, 1997) and the binary synchronous context-free grammar (scfg) employed by the hiero system (chiang, 2005) to model the hierarchical phrases. 
however, in the source-channel approach to machine translation, we need to combine probabilities from the translation model (an scfg) with the language model (an ngram), which has been shown to be very important for translation quality (chiang, 2005). 
in making one nonterminal play dual roles, we follow the de nitions in (aho and ullman, 1972; chiang, 2005), originally known as syntax directed translation schema (sdts). 
as illustrated in figure 2, vpp-vp has contiguous spans on both source and target sides, so that we can generate a binary-branching scfg: (2) s→ np (1) v pp-vp (2), np(1) v pp-vp (2) vpp-vp → vp(1) pp(2), pp(2) vp(1) in this case m-gram integrated decoding can be done in o(|w|3+4(m−1)) time which is much lowerorder polynomial and no longer depends on rule size (wu, 1996), allowing the search to be much faster and more accurate facing pruning, as is evidenced in the hiero system of chiang (2005) where he restricts the hierarchical phrases to be a binary scfg. 
synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (aho and ullman, 1972; wu, 1997; yamada and knight, 2001; melamed, 2003; chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently. 
so instead of determinization, here we present a simple-yet-effective extension to the algorithm 3 of huang and chiang (2005) that guarantees to output unique translated strings: • keep a hash-table of unique strings at each vertex in the hypergraph • when asking for the next-best derivation of a vertex, keep asking until we get a new string, and then add it into the hash-table this method should work in general for any equivalence relation (say, same derived tree) that can be defined on derivations. 
both yamada and knight (2001) and chiang (2005) use scfgs as the underlying model, so their translation schemata are syntax-directed as in fig. 
besides, our model, as being linguistically motivated, is also more expressive than the formally syntax-based models of chiang (2005) and wu (1997). 
in contrast, their decodings are reported to be computationally expensive and chiang (2005) uses aggressive pruning to make it tractable. 
additionally, we incorporate the pruning techniques used in (chiang 2005), by which any hypothesis with a probability lower than times the highest probability for one sentence is discarded. 
chiang (2005) has recently shown significant improvements in translation accuracy, using synchronous grammars. 
analogous techniques for tree-structured translation models involve either allowing each nonterminal to generate both terminals and other nonterminals (groves et al, 2004; chiang, 2005), or, given a constraining parse tree, to “flatten” it (fox, 2002; zens and ney, 2003; galley et al, 2004). 
in recent years, phrase-based systems (koehn, 2004; chiang, 2005) have been shown to outperform word-based mt systems; therefore,inthispaper,weuseapublicly-available phrase-based mt system, pharaoh (koehn, 2004), to investigate the impact of different alignments. 
although it is possible to estimate phrases directly from a training corpus (marcu and wong, 2002), most phrase-based mt systems (koehn, 2004; chiang, 2005) start with a word alignment and extract phrases that are consistent with the given alignment. 
from this point, our decoder is similar to the work by chiang (2005). 
another smart reordering model was proposed by chiang (2005). 
these features are very common in state-of-the-art systems (koehn et al, 2005; chiang, 2005) and λs are weights of features. 
when tested on top of two state-of-the-art systems, the collins/bikel parser (bikel, 2004) and chiang’s cky-based hiero decoder (chiang, 2005), this algorithm is shown to have very little overhead even for quite large k (say, 106) (see fig. 
these algorithms have been re-implemented by other researchers in the field, including eugene charniak for his n-best parser, ryan mcdonald for his dependency parser (mcdonald et al, 2005), microsoft research nlp group (simon corston-oliver and kevin duh, p.c.) for a similar model, jonathan graehl for the isi syntax-based mt decoder, david a. smith for the dyna language (eisner et al, 2005), 223 and jonathan may for isi’s tree automata package tiburon. 
many researchers have explored syntax-based methods, for instance, wu (1996) and chiang (2005) both uses binary-branching synchronous context-free grammars (scfgs). 
so i co-developed several fast and exact algorithms for kbest parsing in the general framework of directed monotonic hypergraphs (huang and chiang, 2005). 
chiang (2005) presents a hierarchical phrase-based model that uses hierarchical phrase pairs, which are formally productions of a synchronous context-free grammar. 
table 1 shows the tats extracted from the tsa in figure 3 with h = 2 and c = 2. as we restrict that t(fj2j1 ) must be a subtree of t(fj1 ), tats may be treated as syntactic hierarchical phrase pairs (chiang, 2005) with tree structure on the source side. 
some approaches have used syntax at the core (wu, 1997; alshawi et al, 2000; yamada and knight, 2001; gildea, 2003; eisner, 2003; hearne and way, 2003; melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (xia and mccord, 2004; chiang, 2005; collins et al, 2005; quirk et al, 2005). 
variations of scfgs go back to aho and ullman (1972)'s syntax-directed translation schemata, but also include the inversion transduction grammars in wu (1997), which restrict grammar rules to be binary, the synchronous grammars in chiang (2005), which use only a single nonterminal symbol, and the multitext grammars in melamed (2003), which allow independent rewriting, as well as other tree-based models such as yamada and knight (2001) and galley et al (2004). 
we used the n-best list generated by the hiero smt system (chiang, 2005). 
and syntax-inspired formal models (chiang, 2005), in spite of being trained on significantly less data, have shown promising results when compared on the same test sets with mature phrase-based systems. 
the spmt models are similar to the models proposed by chiang (2005) and galley et al (2006). 
(chiang, 2005) proposes an heuristic way of acquiring context free transfer rules that significantly improves upon a standard phrase-based model. 
the other is a hierarchical phrase-based translation in which translation is realized as a set of paired production rules (chiang, 2005). 
in the hierarchical phrase-based model, production rules are accumulated by computing “holes” for extracted contiguous phrases (chiang, 2005)
recent research into syntax-based smt (quirk and menezes 2005; chiang 2005) has produced promising results in addressing some of the problems; research motivated by other statistical models has helped to address others (banchs et al 2005). 
given a fixed length limit, the number of surface phrases extracted from any sentence pair of length n where all words are uniquely aligned is o(n), but the number of treelets is potentially exponential in the number of children; and the number of rules with two gaps extracted by chiang (2005) is potentially o(n3). 
hierarchical phrases recent work in the use of hierarchical phrases (chiang 2005) improves the ability to capture linguistic generalizations, and also removes the limitation to contiguous phrases.
