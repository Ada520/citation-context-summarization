other research efforts analyze opinion expressions at the sentence level or below to recognize opinions, their polarity, and their strength (e.g., dave et al (2003), pang and lee (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)). 
yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level (pang et al, 2002; turney, 2002), or the sentence or word level (wiebe et al, 2004; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003). 
there are studies on learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (turney and littman, 2003; pang et al, 2002; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; morinaga et al, 2002).
