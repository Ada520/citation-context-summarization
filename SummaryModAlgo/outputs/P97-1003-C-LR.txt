these confidence values can be derived in a number of sensible ways; the technique used by collins was adapted from that used in bikel et al (1997), which makes use of a quantity called the diversity of the history context (witten and bell 1991), which is equal to the number of unique futures observed in training for that history context. 
in particular, the model in collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deficiency of the model. 
moreover, the deterministic dependency parser of yamada and matsumoto (2003), when trained on the penn treebank, gives a dependency accuracy that is almost as good as that of collins (1997) and charniak (2000). 
nasrÂ©lia, univ-avignon, fr) :~cogentex, inc. (owenocogentex.com) 1 introduction dependency grammar has a long tradition in syntactic theory, dating back to at least tesni~re's work from the thirties3 recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing are discovering the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly do, but context-free phrasestructure grammars do not. 
collins et al (1999) applied the parser of collins (1997) developed for english, to czech, and found thatthe performance was substantially lower when compared to the results for english.
