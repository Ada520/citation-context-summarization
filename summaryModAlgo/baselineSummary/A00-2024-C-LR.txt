jing and mckeown (2000) and jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences. 
we analyzed a set of articles and identified six major operations that can be used for editing the extracted sentences, including removing extraneous phrases from an extracted sentence, combining a reduced sentence with other sentences, syntactic transformation, substituting phrases in an extracted sentence with their paraphrases, substituting phrases with more general or specific descriptions, and reordering the extracted sentences (jing and mckeown, 1999; jing and mckeown, 2000). 
additionally, some research has explored cutting and pasting segments of text from the full document to generate a summary (jing and mckeown 2000).
