our work is related to previous work on domain independent unsupervised relation extraction, in particular sekine (2006),<papid> P06-2094 </papid>shinyama and sekine (2006) <papid> P06-2094 </papid>and banko et al (2007).sekine (2006) <papid> P06-2094 </papid>introduces on-demand information extraction, which aims at automatically identifying salient patterns and extracting relations based on these patterns.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>he retrieves relevant documents from newspaper corpus based on query and applies pos tagger, dependency analyzer and an extended netagger.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>using the information from the taggers, he extracts patterns and applies paraphrase recognition to create sets of semantically similar patterns.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>shinyama and sekine (2006) <papid> P06-2094 </papid>apply ner, coreference resolution and parsing to corpus of newspaper articles to extract two-place relations between nes.</nextsent>
<nextsent>the extracted relations are grouped into pattern tables of ne pairs expressing the same relation, e.g., hurricanes and their locations.</nextsent>
