in addition to sentence fusion, compression algorithms (chandrasekar, doran, and bangalore 1996; grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; knight and marcu 2002; jing and mckeown 2000; reizler et al 2003) and methods for expansion of a multiparallel corpus (pang, knight, and marcu 2003) are other instances of such methods. 
our work in sentence reformulation is different from cut-and-paste summarization (jing and mckeown 2000) in many ways. 
while this approach exploits only syntactic and lexical information, jing and mckeown (2000) also rely on cohesion information, derived from word distribution in a text: phrases that are linked to a local context are retained, while phrases that have no such links are dropped.
