many probabilistic evaluation models have been published inspired by one or more of these feature types [black, 1992] [briscoe, 1993] [charniak, 1997] [collins, 1996] [collins, 1997] [magerman, 1995] [eisner, 1996], but discrepancies between training sets, algorithms, and hardware environments make it difficult, if not impossible, to compare the models objectively. 
of particular relevance is other work on parsing the penn wsj treebank (jelinek et al 1994; magerman 1995; eisner 1996a, 1996b; collins 1996; charniak 1997; goodman 1997; ratnaparkhi 1997; chelba and jelinek 1998; roark 2001).
