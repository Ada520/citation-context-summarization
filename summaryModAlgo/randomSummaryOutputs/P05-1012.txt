additional features are created by combining these atomic features, as described in (mcdonald et al, 2005). 
partial parsing (carreras et al, 2005) or even dependency parsing (mcdonald et al, 2005). 
decoding instead of using the mst algorithm (mcdonald et al, 2005b) to maximise equation 1, we present an equivalent ilp formulation of the problem. 
to train a77 we follow the large margin training approach of (taskar et al, 2003; tsochantaridis et al, 2004), which has been applied with great success to dependency parsing (taskar et al, 2004; mcdonald et al, 2005). 
to learn these structures we used online large-margin learning (mcdonald et al, 2005) that empirically provides state-of-the-art performance for czech.
