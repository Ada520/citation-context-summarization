after that, several million instances of people, locations, and other facts were added (fleischman et al, 2003). 
in our future work we plan to investigate the effect of more sophisticated and, probably, more accurate filtering methods (fleischman et al, 2003) on the qa results. 
there have been several approaches to automatically discovering lexico-semantic information from text (hearst 1992; riloff and shepherd 1997; riloff and jones 1999; berland and charniak 1999; pantel and lin 2002; fleischman et al 2003; girju et al 2003). 
we compared our system with the concepts in wordnet and fleischman et al's instance/concept relations (fleischman et al 2003). 
in recent years, learning components have started to permeate question answering (clarke et al, 2003; ravichandran et al, 2003; echihabi and marcu, 2003). 
(fleischman et al, 2003) also propose a supervised algorithm that uses part of speech patterns and a large corpus to extract semantic relations for who-is type questions. 
another direction we are pursuing is the use of machine learning techniques to learn predictors of good nuggets, much like the work of fleischman et al (2003). 
mann (2002) and fleischman et al (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involving proper nouns. 
the experimental results are presented in section 4. we discuss related issues and future work in section 5. 2 related work question answering has attracted much attention from the areas of natural language processing, information retrieval and data mining (fleischman et al, 2003; echihabi et al, 2003; yang et al, 2003; hermjakob et al, 2002; dumais et al, 2002; hermjakob et al, 2000). 
the row labelled precision shows the precision of the extracted information (i.e., how many entries are correct, according to a human annotator) estimated by random sampling and manual evaluation of 1% of the data for each table, similar to (fleischman et al, 2003). 
3.2 questions and corpus to get a clear picture of the impact of using different information extraction methods for the offline construction of knowledge bases, similarly to (fleischman et al, 2003), we focused only on questions about persons, taken from the trec8 through trec 2003 question sets. 
in contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (riloff and jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (thelen and riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (collins and singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (agichtein and gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as question answering (lita and carbonell, 2004; fleischman et al, 2003). 
the precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (fleischman et al, 2003). 
data fleischman et al (2003) describe a dataset of concept-instance pairs extracted automatically from a very large corpus of newspaper articles. 
some of these patterns are similar to the ones discovered by hearst (1992) while other patterns are similar to the ones used by fleischman et al (2003). 
the recall problem is usually addressed by increasing the amount of text data for extraction (taking larger collections (fleischman et al, 2003)) or by developing more surface patterns (soubbotin and soubbotin, 2002). 
this approach is similar in spirit to the work reported by fleischman et al (2003) and mann (2002), except that our system benefits from a greater variety of patterns and answers a broader range of questions. 
question answering has emerged as a key area in natural language processing (nlp) to apply question parsing, information extraction, summarization, and language generation techniques (clark et al, 2004; fleischman et al, 2003; echihabi et al, 2003; yang et al, 2003; hermjakob et al, 2002; dumais et al, 2002). 
fleischman et al (2003) focus on the precision of the information extracted using simple part-of-speech patterns. 
in particular, we use the name/instance lists described by (fleischman et al, 2003) and available on fleischman's web page to generate features between names and nominals (this list contains a110a111a85 pairs mined from a112a73a96 gbs of news data). 
this confirms the results of fleischman et al (2003): shallow methods may benefit significantly from the post-processing. 
mann (2002) and fleischman et al (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involing proper nouns. 
definition questions following fleischman et al (2003), we select the 50 definition questions from the trec2003 (voorhees 2003) question set. 
we do not use particular lexicosyntactic patterns, as previous attempts have (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
at the same time, research efforts in data acquisition promise to deliver increasingly larger question-answer datasets (girju et al, 2003; fleischman et al, 2003). 
we propose to study and develop several kernel methods that can operate in support vector machines for determining the optimal strategies and compare the results with the maximum entropy combinations reported in (echihabi and marcu, 2003). 
hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various nlp systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003).
