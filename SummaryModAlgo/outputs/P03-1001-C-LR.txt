the precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (fleischman et al, 2003). 
fleischman et al (2003) focus on the precision of the information extracted using simple part-of-speech patterns. 
we do not use particular lexicosyntactic patterns, as previous attempts have (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
in contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (riloff and jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (thelen and riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (collins and singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (agichtein and gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as question answering (lita and carbonell, 2004; fleischman et al, 2003). 
mann (2002) and fleischman et al (2003) used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of hyponym relations involing proper nouns.
