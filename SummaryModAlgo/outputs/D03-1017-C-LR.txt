yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003) provide methods for sentence-level analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification. 
so far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003; riloff and wiebe, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; pang et al, 2002; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; morinaga et al, 2002). 
dave et al (2003), riloff and wiebe (2003), bethard et al (2004), pang and lee (2004), wilson et al (2004), yu and hatzivassiloglou (2003), wiebe and riloff (2005)). 
the second is subjectivity classification of sentences, clauses, phrases, or word instances in the context of a particular text or conversation, either subjective/objective classifications or positive/negative sentiment classifications (e.g.,(riloff and wiebe, 2003; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; dave et al, 2003; hu and liu, 2004)). 
so far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language (wiebe et al, 2004; riloff et al, 2003), identifying opinionated documents (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003) and sentences (yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; riloff et al, 2003), and discriminating between positive and negative language (pang et al, 2002; morinaga et al, 2002; yu and hatzivassiloglou, 2003; turney and littman, 2003; dave et al, 2003; nasukawa and yi, 2003; popescu and etzioni, 2005; wilson et al, 2005).
