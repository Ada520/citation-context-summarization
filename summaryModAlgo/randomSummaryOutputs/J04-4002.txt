an aligned phrase pair is consistent with the word alignment if neither phrase contains any word aligning to a word outside the other phrase (och and ney, 2004). 
first, many-to-many word alignments are induced by running a one-to-many word alignment model, such as giza++ (och and ney, 2003), in both directions and by combining the results based on a heuristic (och and ney, 2004). 
obviously, the npa is a special case of the phrase extractor in (och and ney, 2004) in that it considers only one phrase alignment rather than all possible ones. 
we compare our syntax-based system against an implementation of the alignment template (altemp) approach to mt (och and ney, 2004), which is widely considered to represent the state of the art in the field.
