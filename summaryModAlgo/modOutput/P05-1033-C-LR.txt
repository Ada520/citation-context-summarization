some approaches have used syntax at the core (wu, 1997; alshawi et al, 2000; yamada and knight, 2001; gildea, 2003; eisner, 2003; hearne and way, 2003; melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (xia and mccord, 2004; chiang, 2005; collins et al, 2005; quirk et al, 2005). 
to find such groups of morphemes and functional words, we applied a sequence of morpheme groupings by extracting frequently occuring n-grams of morphemes as follows (much like the grouping used by chiang (2005): in a series of iterations, we obtained high-frequency bigrams from the morphemic representation of parallel texts, of either morphemes, or of previously such identified morpheme groups and neighboring morphemes until up to four morphemes or one root 3 morpheme could be combined.
