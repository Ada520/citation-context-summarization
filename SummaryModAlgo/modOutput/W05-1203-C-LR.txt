in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dectors: the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivationally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in wordnet, and, finally, a wordnet-based similarity (jiang and conrath, 1997). 
also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in corley and mihalcea (2005). 
then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function. 
we also used the following resources: the charniak parser (charniak, 2000) to carry out the syntactic analysis; the wn::similaritypackage (pedersen et al, 2004) to compute the jiang-conrath (j-c) distance (jiang and conrath, 1997) needed to implement the lexical similarity siml(t,h) as defined in (corley and mihalcea, 2005); svm-lighttk (moschitti, 2004) to encode the basic tree kernel function, kt , in svm-light (joachims, 1999). 
first, as observed in (corley and mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e.
