taking a stepfurther, the tease algorithm (szpektoretal., 2004) provides a completely unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the web for a given input relation (see section 5.1). 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2003), and other relations. 
the tease algorithm (szpektor et al, 2004) is an unsupervised method for acquiring entailment relations from the web for a given input template. 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2006), and other relations. 
next, we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web (szpektor et al, 2004), the minipar dependency parser (lin, 1998) and a syntactic matching module.
