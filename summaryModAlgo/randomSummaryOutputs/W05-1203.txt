pr systems that can be broadly categorized as ir-based include (corley and mihalcea, 2005; brockett and dolan, 2005). 
also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in corley and mihalcea (2005). 
in line with (corley and mihalcea, 2005), we define it as: s1(t,h) = summationdisplay (wt,wh)∈a simw(wt,wh)×idf(wh) summationdisplay wh∈wh idf(wh) (3) where idf(w) is the inverse document frequency of the word w. 
we also used the following resources: the charniak parser (charniak, 2000) to carry out the syntactic analysis; the wn::similaritypackage (pedersen et al, 2004) to compute the jiang-conrath (j-c) distance (jiang and conrath, 1997) needed to implement the lexical similarity siml(t,h) as defined in (corley and mihalcea, 2005); svm-lighttk (moschitti, 2004) to encode the basic tree kernel function, kt , in svm-light (joachims, 1999).
