dependency-based representations have become increasingly popular in syntactic parsing, especially for languages that exhibit free or flexible word order, such as czech (collins et al, 1999), bulgarian (marinov and nivre, 2005), and turkish (eryiË˜git and oflazer, 2006). 
we compared our system to the bikel re-implementation of the collins parser (bikel, 2004; collins, 1999) trained with the same head rules of our system.

collins (1997)'s parser and its reimplementation and extension by bikel (2002) have by now been applied to a variety of languages: english (collins, 1999), czech (collins et al, 1999), german (dubey and keller, 2003), spanish (cowan and collins, 2005), french (arun and keller, 2005), chinese (bikel, 2002) and, according to dan bikel's web page, arabic.
