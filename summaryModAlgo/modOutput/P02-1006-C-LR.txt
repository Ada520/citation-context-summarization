unsupervised methods for similar tasks include agichtein and gravano’s (2000) work, which shows that clusters of vector-spacebased patterns can be successfully employed to detect speci c ie relationships (companies and their headquarters), and ravichandran and hovy’s (2002) algorithm for nding patterns for a question answering (qa) task. 
this may just be the m characters to the left or to the right (brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (agichtein and gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
the approach followed for the generalisation is the one described by (alfonseca et al, 2006a; ruiz-casado et al, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to ravichandran and hovy (2002)'s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and named entity labels to the patterns.
