evaluation methods we use the relative utility (ru) method (radev et al, 2000) to compare our various summaries. 
mead is a publicly available toolkit for multi-document summarization (radev et al, 2000; mead, 2003). 
sentence extraction techniques (luhn, 1958; radev et al, 2000), on the other hand, compute a score for each sentence based on certain features and output the most highly ranked sentences. 
however, this experiment differs from prior work in that we use judges to determine the relevance of sentences to sub-events rather than to evaluate summaries (radev et al, 2000). 
topic-oriented multi-document summarization has already been studied in other evaluation initiatives which provide testbeds to compare alternative approaches (over, 2003; goldstein et al, 2000; radev et al, 2000).
