in addition, an automatic evaluation method based on context-free deletion decisions has been proposed by jing (2000). 
sentence simplification systems (chandrasekar et al, 1996; mahesh, 1997; carroll et al, 1998; grefenstette, 1998; jing, 2000; knight and marcu, 2000) are capable of compressing long sentences by deleting unimportant words and phrases. 
(jing, 2000) studied a new method to remove extraneous phrase from sentences by using multiple source of knowledge to decide which phrase in the sentences can be removed. 
between these two extremes, there has been a relatively modest amount of work in sentence simplification (chandrasekar, doran, and bangalore 1996; mahesh 1997; carroll et al 1998; grefenstette 1998; jing 2000; knight and marcu 2002) and document compression (daum´e iii and marcu 2002; daum´e iii and marcu 2004; zajic, dorr, and schwartz 2004) in which words, phrases, and sentences are selected in an extraction process.
