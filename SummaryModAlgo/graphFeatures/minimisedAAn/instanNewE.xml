<nextsent> \[ he second of the abovementioned steps is riot trivial either, though its problems might be solvable after allo for purely axiomatic view of the gpsg formalism it may be permissible to neglect the order in which the different filtering components are to be applied, akhough their seem to be some problems with the definitions of the different fips with respect to their logical independence of each other.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>for an effective implementation however, the ordering problem becomes crucial.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>there are some hints in \[gkps\] referring to interdependencies tween the different filters, but they are not fully specified.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the most problematic case is the order in which the hfc and the cap have to be applied: ? the hfc seems to presuppose the effects of the cap (and of the ffp) because it must not force feature specifications that are excluded by the capon categories in local trees; ? the cap presupposes the flec in the sense that it is based on semantic types, which are dependent on head features, the distribution ofwhich is in turn governed by the hfc.

<citsent citstr=" C86-1050 ">
one possible way out of this dilemma is suggested in \[shieber 1986\], <papid> C86-1050 </papid>but it is based on the assumption that head features may be split up into two disjoint sets: those head features which are prerequisites for the assignment of semantic types and thus for the applicability of the cap, and those head features that can safely be applied after the cap has done its work.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>however, it is not clear whether such distribution is possible.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>of course, you can always make your id rules much more informative with respect to feature specifications than is suggested in \[gkps\] and thereby guarantee proper functioning of the fips; but that would probably not be in the spirit of gpsg, where the main point is to capture the universal as well as the language-specific generalizations.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>there e number of problems with the cap; we waut to outline just one of them, which has led us to modify this principle.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the definition of control in \[gkps\] implicitly restricts the functioning of cap to structures where the functor has no more than one argument (with the exception of those very special cases of control mediators).

<prevsent>in our example, number and case specifications are spread over the sub-structure dominated by the np as soon as the fips apply to the local tree where they have been introduced.

<prevsent>however, such delayed specification makes it more difficult to maintain control over whether category is still legal and whether local tree still complies with the lp statements.

<aftsection>
<nextsent>in our present version of gpsg, we use neither meta rules nor fsd.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>however, the linguist ought to still have the possibility of expressing elegantly language-particular generalizations with the aid of metarules.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>they will be realized in preprocessing component in order to avoid having to apply them during parsing or during generation.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>as for fsds, we adopt the working hypothesis that they are superfluous if lexical entries are sufficiently specified and free feature instantiation (in the sense of \[gkps\]) is not allowed.

<aftsection>
<nextsent>in this scenario, both the system and the user have knowledge about both source and target language, and it is sometimes difficult to see where the most appropriate division of labour should occur: indeed, there is sometimes conflict between what the system offers the translator-user, and what the user already 271 knows, or between the extent to which the system or the user should take the initiative, which might differ from occasion to occasion.

<aftsection>
<nextsent>the binding rule presented here improves over the standard statement of the binding theory in two respects: from an empirical point of view, the new rule accounts for crossover binding phenomena /kuno, 1987/ without recourse to reconstruction /chomsky, 1981/; from practical point of view, the new rule is more computationally sensible than the generate-and-test approach understood in chomsky theory, and hence is plausible candi-date for incorporation in natural-language parsers that account ot anaphora.

<prevsent>the binding rule presented here improves over the standard statement of the binding theory in two respects: from an empirical point of view, the new rule accounts for crossover binding phenomena /kuno, 1987/ without recourse to reconstruction /chomsky, 1981/; from practical point of view, the new rule is more computationally sensible than the generate-and-test approach understood in chomsky theory, and hence is plausible candi-date for incorporation in natural-language parsers that account ot anaphora.</prevsent>

in general, the effects of the temptation to allow, for example, the evaluation of arbitrary lisp expressions on the ares of the atn or the addition of  procedural programming facilities  to the rule-based skeleton of 1bm plnlp have been discussed at length in the recent literature addressing the issues of declarative formalisms from theoretical perspective (see shieber, 1986<papid> C86-1050 </papid>a, and references therein).</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>however, from the point of view of developing realistic grammar with substantial coverage, the opening of the procedural  back door , while perhaps useful fo:  patching  the inadequacies in the linguistic theory during the exercise, can turn the whole process of grammar development and maintenance into an orgea~isational ightmare, as side effects accumulate and ripple effects propagate.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>a ~parate problem with allowing procedural attachment into the grammar formalism stems from the inevitable commitment to particular version of particular theory.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>even wben deliberate ffort is made to develop flexible and general framework capable of accomodating range of  underlying  linguistic operations, such framework is bound eventually to become inadequate, especially as modem theories of grammar (strive to) become more declarative and tend to make reference to larger bodies of knowledge.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>a case ha point is the ariane system (vauquois &amp; boitet, 1985): <papid> J85-1003 </papid>even though it was designed as completely integrated programmaing environment, with the aim of enabling implementation of, and experimentation with, different linguistic theories, in reality the system has been unable to cope with radically new grammatical frameworks and computational strategies for text analysis.</nextsent>

<prevsent>human language understanding is apparently in-cremental in the sense of proceeding in piece-meal fashion, (ideally) carried out in small, grad= ual steps as each word is encountered (tyler and marslen-wilson 1977, marslen-wilson and tyler 1980).

<nextsent>furthermore, given framework which integrates parsing and in-terpretation by performing interpretation on-line to the parser, it might be advantageous to allow encod-ing of default reasoning at the level of the parser, as indeed zernik artd brown do, but to use it in nmch more restricted way.

<prevsent>3.2 representation events.
</prevsent>
<prevsent>given our characterization events and actions as described be-fore, and assuming syntactic representation foreach sentence, the next step is to describe the kind of (semantic) representation we use to characterize those events.
</prevsent>
</prevsection>
<citsent citstr=" P81-1028 ">
many representations for events have been proposed to handle similar issues as we describe here \[davidson 1967, moore 1981, <papid> P81-1028 </papid>neale 1987\].</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>the representation we have chosen is aprolog, fortnai logical representation described by \[miller et al  1986\].
</nextsent>
<nextsent>this approach allows us to represent enti-ties describing events and actions in logical and complex way.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>in this representation, the logical form describes the events that char-acterize the sentence (as compared to proposition or individual), therefore allowing subsequent references to any one of the events described by the sentence.

machine translation proceeds akmg similar lines by mapping two  fags directly (abeill6 et al, 1990), in previous work, one of us noted that generation ac-cording to an augmented context-free grammar can be made more efficient by requiring the grammar to be se-mantically monotonic (shieber, 1988); <papid> C88-2128 </papid>the derived se-mantics for an expression must include, in an appropri-ate sense, the semantic material of all its subconstituents.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>it is interesting to note that synchronous  fags are in-herently semantically monotonic.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>furthermore, it is rea-sonable to require that the semantic omponent of syn-chronous tag t~ lexicalized (in the sense of schabes et al.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>(1988)), allowing for more efficient parsing accord-ing to the semantic grammar and, consequenlly, more efficient generation.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>in the case of augmented context- free grammars, the semantic monotonicity requirement precludes  lexicalization  of the semantics.

<nextsent>binding theory (bt) is module of the government and binding theory ruling the distribution and the referential properties of anaphors (such as himself), pronouns (such as him and his) and r(eferential)- expressions ( uch as john, the man met yesterday, my sister, etc).
</nextsent>
<nextsent>here we will briefly illustrate its scope, without entering into detailed analysis.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>it is well known fact that lexical items, such as noun phrases, must undergo an interpretation process by which they are assigned referent.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>such process is ruled by principles that vary according to the nature of the item in question, i.e. anaphor, pronoun or r- expression.

<prevsent>tm finally, given the referential properties of pronouns, it seems that there is no point in trying to use the grammatical knowledge of bt to hypothesise intra sentential antecedenks, t9 another crucial aspect concerns the treatment of local domains, whose importance has often been mis considered in computational works on bt.
</prevsent>
<prevsent>such notion has been mainly seen as static one, whereas, in our interpretation, the value of the actual domain depends on the interaction of structural and lexical properties of at least two different positions in the derivation tree.
</prevsent>
</prevsection>
<citsent citstr=" P89-1032 ">
for example, in ingria and stallard (1989), <papid> P89-1032 </papid>an node is taken to be the binding domain for every node it dominates.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>consider, however, the cases in which government of the specifier position of maximal projection is obtained through an external head; this situation arises, for instance, in exceptional case marking examples, as in john believed him to be intelligent.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>ingria and stallard tatic definition of local domain would lead to the conclusion that the pronoun, being dominated by an type node (the embedded sentence), is free in that category and, thus, could be co indexed outside, for instance with the r-expression john.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>but this is ungrammatical; according to the definition adopted here, the domain of binding for him is the matrix clause, so that the pronoun must, correctly, be free in it, i.e, disjoint from john.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>our approach also improves on ingria and smllard treatment of np as binding domain.

<prevsent>now, in the augmented chart parsing this principle is still held; except hat the inactive dge doesn have to share the same vertex with the active edge a; instead it can be separated from the active edge a, as long as there exists jump edge linking edges and i. the augmented chart parsing scheme proposed here is not only very useful and efficient rule-based grammar applications, but is equally useful and efficient in other applications uch as lexicalized grammar (e.g. 4 63 ,hpsg(pollard, 1987) ) in which the syntactical relationships are stated as part of the lexical description, and in the augmented chart the structures to be assigned to the input may be extended to attribute-value matrices (complex feature structures) instead of syntactic parsing trees and the recognition algorithm may relyon the head-driven slot and filler principle instead of derivation oriented recognition.
</prevsent>
<prevsent>such an extension is in fact straightforward.
</prevsent>
</prevsection>
<citsent citstr=" C88-1049 ">
furthermore, in some other approaches to increase the flexibility of the slot and filler principle, such as island parsing (stock, 1988) and discontinuous segmented parsing (hellwig, 1988), <papid> C88-1049 </papid>the augmented chart proposed here can also be easily extended and applied.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>in order to see how the above, concept  for augmented chart parsing works, bottom-up and left-to-right parser based on the proposed augmented chart (also capable of perforating conventional chart parsing) has been implemented and tested in some preliminary experiments.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the test database includes large number of chinese word lattices obtained from an acoustic signal processor which recognizes mandarin speech.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>due to the existence of large number of homonyms in chinese language and uncertainty and errors in speech recognition, very high degree of iexical ambiguity exists in the input lattices.

<prevsent>this paper describes the approach taken to the uni-fication of disjunctive feature structures in an exper-imental bottom-up shift-reduce japanese aaalyser called propane, for prolog parser using the nadine grammar.
</prevsent>
<prevsent>nadine (kogure, 1989; kogure and na-gata, 1990), which is inlplemented in lisp, is the analysis and translation component of slo trans, the spoken language translation system under de-velopment at atit interpreting telephony research laboratories, and its large (12,000 line) grammar and lexicon make extensive use of disjunction.

the general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of dis junctions (kasper, 1987).<papid> P87-1033 </papid></citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>that is, barring rev-olutionary developments in the theory of algorithms, the problem is np-complete, and the time taken to pertbrm such unification can, in general, at best be an exponentially increasing function of the number of dis junctions, tlowever, in writing large grammars of natural anguages, it is often convenient to be able to specify constraints in terms of disjunctions.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>this seems especially to be the case for japanese, because of its relatively free word order and widespread el-lipsis.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>it is therefore important develop unifica-tion algorithms that can in practice unify disjunctive feature structures in reasonable time, despite the inherent np-completeness of the task.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>70 propane unification method embodies two novel techniques.

<prevsent>the initial impetus for building computa-tional lexicon arose from the needs of the cri-tique text-critiquing system (previously called epistle, ileidom et al 1982).
</prevsent>
<prevsent>basic syntactic information such as part of speech, subcategori-zation for verbs (e.g. trans, intrans, complement taking properties), irregular forms, some inherent semantic information (such as male, female for nouns), some graphemic, phonological, and stylistic b15 features were gathered from range of (primarily) maelfine-readable sources.

this system (called udict, the ultimate dictionary) is described in byrd 1983 and byrd et al 1986.<papid> P86-1019 </papid></citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>a modified version of the original dictionary is still in use by that project.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>our experience in attempting to build solid broad-coverage computational lexicon revealed to us the range of projects potentially in need of such lexical resource.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>unfortunately, it also revealed to us range of problems.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>first, the projects: we received requests for information from nia  projects such as the experimental english-to- german machine translation system i,mt /mccord 1988/, the natural language data hase query project tqa/damerau et al 1982, johnson 1984/, the kind-types knowledge representation system kt /dahlgrcn and mcdowell 1986/, and others.
