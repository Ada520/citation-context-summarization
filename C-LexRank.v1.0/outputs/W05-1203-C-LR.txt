it has already been applied in this way by corley & mihalcea (2005) and wu (2005). 
the wn::similarity package (pedersen et al, 2004) to compute the jiang&conrath (j-c) distance (jiang and conrath, 1997) as in (corley and mihalcea, 2005). 
our approach is in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005; glickman et al, 2005)). 
second, we can use one of the wordnet (miller, 1995) similarities indicated with d(lw,lwprime) (in line with what was done in (corley and mihalcea, 2005)) and different relation between words such as the lexical entailment between verbs (ent) and derivationally relation between words (der). 
then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function.
