our approach extends previously formulated ones that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic relations between nouns (hearst 1992; etzioni 2003; ravichandran and hovy 2002). 
we assume that the system has used the seed list to extract and generalise a set of patterns for each of the relations using training corpora (ravichandran and hovy, 2002; alfonseca et al, 2006a). 
on the other hand, we have rerun ravichandran and hovy (2002)â€™s algorithm on our corpus.
