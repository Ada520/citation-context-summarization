then (riloff and thelen, 2000) and (charniak et al, 2000) reported improvements to 39.7% and 41%, respectively. 
it has been observed in prior work (charniak et al, 2000; riloff and thelen, 2000) that such sentences may be more likely to be the answer sentences to some question type (for example, dateline can answer to when questions). 
we also compared our results across various interrogatives with those previously reported in (riloff and thelen, 2000). 
keywords in questions it has been observed in the work of (riloff and thelen, 2000) that certain words in a when or where question tend to indicate that the dateline is an ~n~wer sentence to the question.
