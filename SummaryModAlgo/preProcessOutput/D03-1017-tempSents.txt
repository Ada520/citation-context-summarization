9	most of the annotation approaches tackling these issues, however, are aimed at performing classifications at either the document level , or the sentence or word level . 
15	this amounts to performing binary text categorization under categories objective and subjective ; 2. determining document orientation , as in deciding if a given subjective text expresses a positive or a negative opinion on its subject matter ; 3. determining the strength of document orientation, as in deciding e.g. 
7	admittedly, the high accuracy achieved using such a simple set of features is somewhat surprising, although it is consistent with previous results on document-level subjectivity classification in which accuracies of 94-97% were obtained . 
14	other research efforts analyze opinion expressions at the sentence level or below to recognize opinions, their polarity, and their strength , pang and lee , wilson et al , yu and hatzivassiloglou , wiebe and riloff ). 
12	for example, researchers have identified semantic correlation between words and views: positive words tend to appear more frequently in positive movie and product reviews and newswire article sentences that have a positive semantic orientation and vice versa for negative reviews or sentences with a negative semantic orientation. 
34	we wish to study opinion in general; our work most closely resembles that of . 
3	interestingly, yu and hatzivassiloglou compared an individual-preference classifier against a relationship-based method, but didn‚Äôt combine the two; the ability to coordinate such algorithms is precisely one of the strengths of our approach. 
32	the annotations in yu and hatzivassiloglou are sentence-level subjective vs. objective and polarity judgments. 
37	the second is subjectivity classification of sentences, clauses, phrases, or word instances in the context of a particular text or conversation, either subjective/objective classifications or positive/negative sentiment classifications ). 
25	this approach has been recently applied to the construction of paragraph-long answers ). 
16	second, a number of methods for subjectivity or sentiment analysis start with a set of seed words and then search through wordnet to find other subjective words . 
6	turney proposed the unsupervised method for sentiment classification , and similar method is utilized by many other researchers . 
18	there are studies on learning subjective language , identifying opinionated documents and sentences , and discriminating between positive and negative language . 
2	many applications could benefit from these opinion analyzers, including product reputation tracking , yi et al ), opinion-oriented summarization ), and question answering , yu and hatzivassiloglou ). 
38	yu and hatzivassiloglou provide methods for sentence-level analysis and for determining whether a document is subjective or not, but do not combine these two types of algorithms or consider document polarity classification. 
19	dave et al , riloff and wiebe , bethard et al , wilson et al , yu and hatzivassiloglou , choi et al , kim and hovy , wiebe and riloff ). 
35	there have been attempts on tackling this so-called document-level subjectivity classification task, with very encouraging results and wiebe et al for details). 
28	so far research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language , identifying opinionated documents and sentences , and discriminating between positive and negative language . 
1	yu and hatzivassiloglou ) and classifying the polarity based solely on the subjective portions of the document ). 
21	yu and hatzivassiloglou extend this approach by applying it at the sentence level , taking into account non-adjectival parts-of-speech, and 1 for domain-specificity of sentiment classification see engstr√∂m and aue and gamon . 
13	there is also a considerable amount of research on classification of text as subjective or objectiveù , a task that is not relevant for the processing of very brief pieces of direct customer feedback. 
4	yu and hatzivassiloglou identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
8	so far, research in automatic opinion recognition has primarily addressed learning subjective language , identifying opinionated documents and sentences , and discriminating between positive and negative language . 
23	yu and hatzivassiloglou identified the polarity of opinion sentences using semantically oriented words. 
36	the field of sentiment classification has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years . 
17	riloff and wiebe , bethard et al , wilson et al , yu and hatzivassiloglou , wiebe and riloff ) have shown that sentiment information can be extracted at the sentence, clause, or individual opinion expression level . 
31	the first group includes methods that rely on syntactic or co-occurrence patterns of words in large texts to determine their sentiment and others). 
11	in addition to appraisal theory, subjectivity annotation of text in context has also been performed in yu and hatzivassiloglou , bruce and wiebe , and wiebe et al . 
33	there is a large body of work on classifying the polarity of a document , turney ), a sentence , yu and hatzivassiloglou , kim and hovy , gamon et al ), a phrase ), and a specific object mentioned in a document , yi et al , popescu and etzioni ). 
5	lexical cues of differing complexities have been used, including single words and ngrams ), as well as phrases and lexico-syntactic patterns (e.g, 
26	most prior work on the specific problem of categorizing expressly opinionated text has focused on the binary distinction of positive vs. negative . 
39	dave et al , riloff and wiebe , bethard et al , pang and lee , wilson et al , yu and hatzivassiloglou , wiebe and riloff ). 
24	yu and hatzivassiloglou , kim and hovy , hu and liu , and grefenstette et al all begin by first creating prior-polarity lexicons. 
10	for example, the following opinions contain claims but no sentiments: ‚Äúi believe the world is flat‚Äù ‚Äúthe gap is likely to go bankrupt‚Äù ‚Äúbin laden is hiding in pakistan‚Äù ‚Äúwater always flushes anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere‚Äù like yu and hatzivassiloglou , we want to automatically identify sentiments, which in this work we define as an explicit or implicit expression in text of the holder‚Äôs positive, negative, or neutral regard toward the claim about the topic. 
30	for example, yu and hatzivassiloglou separated facts from opinions and assigned polarities only to opinions. 
29	in analyzing opinions , judging document-level subjectivity , and answering opinion questions , the output of a sentence-level subjectivity classification can be used without modification. 
27	dave et al , riloff and wiebe , bethard et al , pang and lee , wilson et al , yu and hatzivassiloglou , wiebe and riloff ). 
22	following the insight of yu and hatzivassiloglou , we made the basic and rough assumption that words that appear more often in newspaper editorials and letters to the editor than in non-editorial news articles could be potential opinion-bearing words . 
20	recent computational work either focuses on sentence ‚Äòsubjectivity‚Äô , concentrates just on explicit statements of evaluation, such as of films , or focuses on just one aspect of opinion, e.g., on adjectives.
