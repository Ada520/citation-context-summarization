if projectivity (no crossing branches) is desired, eisner's (1996) dynamic programming algorithm (similar to cyk) for dependency parsing can be used instead. 
also, a number of parsers have been developed for some dependency frameworks (covington 1990) (kwon, yoon 1991) (sleator, temperley 1993) (hahn et al 1994) (lombardo, lesmo 1996), including a stochastic treatment (eisner 1996) and an object-oriented parallel parsing method (neuhaus, hahn 1996). 
this kind of restriction is present in many dependency-based parsing systems (mccord, 1990; sleator and temperley, 1991; eisner, 1996). 
if the parse has to be projective, eisner's bottom-up-span algorithm (eisner, 1996) can be used for the search.
