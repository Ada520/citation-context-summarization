synchronous grammar formalisms that are capable of modeling such complex relationships while maintaining the context-free property in each language have been proposed for many years, (aho and ullman, 1972; wu, 1997; yamada and knight, 2001; melamed, 2003; chiang, 2005), but have not been scaled to large corpora and long sentences until recently. 
in this paper, we discuss a new hierarchical phrase-based statistical machine translation system (chiang, 2005), presenting recent extensions to the original proposal, new evaluation results in a community-wide evaluation, and a novel technique for fine-grained comparative analysis of mt systems. 
several recent syntax-based models for machine translation (chiang, 2005; galley et al, 2004) can be seen as instances of the general framework of synchronous grammars and tree transducers. 
recent work in machine translation has evolved from the traditional word (brown et al, 1993) and phrase based (koehn et al, 2003a) models to include hierarchical phrase models (chiang, 2005) and bilingual synchronous grammars (melamed, 2004). 
complete mrs are then formed by combining these nl substrings and their translations under a parsing framework called the synchronous cfg (aho and ullman, 1972), which forms the basis of most existing statistical syntax-based translation models (yamada and knight, 2001; chiang, 2005).
