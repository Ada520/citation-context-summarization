hyponymy relations can play a crucial role in various nlp systems, and there have been many attempts to develop automatic methods to acquire hyponymy relations from text corpora (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
we compared our system with the concepts in wordnet and fleischman et al's instance/concept relations (fleischman et al 2003). 
the precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (fleischman et al, 2003). 
there have been several approaches to automatically discovering lexico-semantic information from text (hearst 1992; riloff and shepherd 1997; riloff and jones 1999; berland and charniak 1999; pantel and lin 2002; fleischman et al 2003; girju et al 2003).
