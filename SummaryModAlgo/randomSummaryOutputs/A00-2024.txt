jing and mckeown (2000) have proposed a rule-based algorithm for sentence combination, but no results have been reported. 
5.3 related works and discussion our two-step model essentially belongs to the same category as the works of (mani et al, 1999) and (jing and mckeown, 2000). 
as previously observed in the literature (mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; jing and mckeown 2000), such components include a clause in the clause conjunction, relative clauses, and some elements within a clause (such as adverbs and prepositions). 
the recent approach for editing extracted text spans (jing and mckeown, 2000) may also produce improvement for our algorithm.
