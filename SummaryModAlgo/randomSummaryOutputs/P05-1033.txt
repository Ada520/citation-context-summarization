baseline pharaoh with phrases extracted from ibm model 4 training with maximum phrase length 7 and extraction method ‘diag-growthfinal’ (koehn et al, 2003a) • lex phrase-decoder simulation: using only the initial lexical rules from the phrase table, all with lhs x, the glue rule, and a binary reordering rule with its own reordering-feature • xcat all nonterminals merged into a single x nonterminal: simulation of the system hiero (chiang, 2005). 
synchronous context-free grammars several definitions for synchronous context-free grammars have been proposed in the literature; see for instance (chiang, 2004; chiang, 2005). 
synchronous parsing has seen a surge of interest recently in the machine translation community as a way of formalizing syntax-based translation models (melamed, 2004; chiang, 2005).
