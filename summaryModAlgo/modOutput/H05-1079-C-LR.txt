we show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (jijkoun and de rijke, 2005), graph alignment (haghighi et al, 2005), weighted abduction (raina et al, 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (bos and markert, 2005). 
(bos and markert, 2005) represents a1 and a0 into a first-order logic translation of the drs language used in discourse representation theory (kamp and reyle, 1993) and uses a theorem prover and a model builder with some generic, lexical and geographical background knowledge to prove the entailment between the two texts. 
for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (bos and markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e.
