our overall test set accuracy of 62.50% represents a 2.1% absolute improvement over the task-independent system described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), and a 20.2% relative improvement in accuracy over their system with respect to an uninformed baseline accuracy of 50%. 
for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (bos and markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
these axioms express knowledge that could not be derived from wordnet regarding employment9, family relations, awards, etc. 5 semantic calculus the semantic calculus axioms combine two semantic relations identified within a text fragment and increase the semantic connectivity of the text (tatu and moldovan, 2005).
