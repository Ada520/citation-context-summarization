jing (2000) proposes a novel algorithm for sentence reduction that takes into account different sources of information to decide whether or not to remove a particular component from a sentence to be included in a summary. 
depending on the chosen task, such systems either generate single-sentence “headlines” for multi-sentence text (witbrock and mittal, 1999), or they provide a sentence condensation module designed for combination with sentence extraction systems (knight and marcu, 2000; jing, 2000). 
sentence reduction the task of the sentence reduction module, described in detail in (jing, 2000), is to remove extraneous phrases from extracted sentences. 
examples include text summarisation (jing 2000), subtitle generation from spoken transcripts (vandeghinste and pan 2004) and information retrieval (olivers and dolan 1999). 
jing and mckeown (2000) and jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences.
