we obtain the word alignments using the method of koehn et al (2003), which is based on that of och and ney (2004). 
for algorithms whose packed representations are graphs, such as hidden markov models and other nitestate methods, ratnaparkhiâ€™s mxparse parser (ratnaparkhi, 1997), and many stack-based machine translation decoders (brown et al, 1995; och and ney, 2004), the k-best paths problem is well-studied in both pure algorithmic context (see (eppstein, 2001) and (brander and sinclair, 1995) for surveys) and nlp/speech community (mohri, 2002; mohri and riley, 2002). 
the alignment template translation model (och and ney, 2004) and related phrase-based models advanced the previous state of the art by moving from words to phrases as the basic unit of translation.
