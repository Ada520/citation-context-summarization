these n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000). 
a topic signature, as described in (lin and hovy, 2000), is a list of terms that can be used to signal the membership of a text in the relevant topic or category. 
other systems exploit the co-occurrence of particular concepts (barzilay and elhadad, 1997; lin and hovy, 2000) or syntactic constraints between concepts (mckeown et al, 1999). 
under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in (lin and hovy, 2000) and (harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a user's domain of interest. 
sembled, topic signatures (lin and hovy, 2000; harabagiu 2004) are computed which identify the set of topic-relevant concepts and relations between concepts that are found in the relevant set of documents.
