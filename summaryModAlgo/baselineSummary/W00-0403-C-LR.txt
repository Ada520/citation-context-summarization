sentence extraction techniques (luhn, 1958; radev et al, 2000), on the other hand, compute a score for each sentence based on certain features and output the most highly ranked sentences. 
evaluation methods we use the relative utility (ru) method (radev et al, 2000) to compare our various summaries. 
mead is a publicly available toolkit for multi-document summarization (radev et al, 2000; mead, 2003). 
mead (radev et al, 2000): mead is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence. 
however, this experiment differs from prior work in that we use judges to determine the relevance of sentences to sub-events rather than to evaluate summaries (radev et al, 2000).
