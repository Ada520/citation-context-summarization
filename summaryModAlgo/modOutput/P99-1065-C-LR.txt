coll1999: the projective lexicalized phrase-structure parser of collins et al (1999). 
as a preprocessing step, the 14 in collins (1999) we erroneously stated that all words occuring less than five times in training data were classified as “unknown.” 
dependency fscore reached on the german negra treebank and collins et al (1999) 80.0% 
we compared our system to the bikel re-implementation of the collins parser (bikel, 2004; collins, 1999) trained with the same head rules of our system. 
we should note that the results in collins et al (1999) are different then reported here due to different training and testing data sets.
