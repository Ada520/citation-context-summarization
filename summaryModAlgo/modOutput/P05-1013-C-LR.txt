to deal with non-projective languages, we use a similar approach of (nivre and nilsson, 2005) to map non-projective trees to projective trees. 
nivre's parser has been tested for swedish (nivre et al, 2004), english (nivre and scholz, 2004), czech (nivre and nilsson, 2005), bulgarian (marinov and nivre, 2005) and chinese cheng et al (2005), while mcdonaldâ€™s parser has been applied to english (mcdonald et al, 2005a), czech (mcdonald et al, 2005b) and, very recently, danish (mcdonald and pereira, 2006). 
graph transformations for recovering non-projective structures (nivre and nilsson, 2005). 
this is in contrast to other non-projective methods, such as that of nivre and nilsson (2005), who implement non-projectivity in a pseudo-projective parser with edge transformations.
