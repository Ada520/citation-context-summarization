we use the data provided for the french-english shared task of the 2003 hltnaacl workshop on building and using parallel texts (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
we also compared the performance on the 447  test sentences to 1/ the intersection of the alignments produced by the top ibm4 alignments in either directions, and 2/ the best systems from (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
this data set was used for the 2003 naacl shared task (mihalcea and ped-ersen, 2003), where the word-aligned sentences were split into a 37 sentencetrial set and a 447 sentence testing set. 
the evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and f-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the alignment error rate (aer), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable.
