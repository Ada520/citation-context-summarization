these n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000). 
to identify these terms,weusethelog-likelihoodstatisticsuggested by dunning (dunning 1993) and first used in summarization by lin and hovy (hovy and lin 2000). 
under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in (lin and hovy, 2000) and (harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a user's domain of interest. 
to deal with a lot of chinese documents which have free style of writing and flexible themes, a sentence-extraction summarization method created by detecting thematic areas is tried following such work as (nomoto and matsumoto, 2001; salton et al, 1996; salton et al, 1997; carbonell and goldstein, 1998; lin and hovy, 2000).
