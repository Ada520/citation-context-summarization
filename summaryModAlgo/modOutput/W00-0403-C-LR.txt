the mead summarizer the mead summarizer [radev et al, 2000] [radev et al 2002] is based on sentence extraction and uses a linear combination of three features to rank the sentences in the source documents. 
mead (radev et al, 2000): mead is a centroid-based extractive summarizer that scores sentences based on sentence-level and inter-sentence features which indicate the quality of the sentence as a summary sentence. 
the first of these, relative utility (ru) (radev et al, 2000) allows model summaries to consist of sentences with variable ranking. 
other commonly used measures include kappa (carletta 1996) and relative utility (radev, jing, and budzikowska 2000), both of which take into account the performance of a summarizer that randomly picks passages from the original document to produce an extract.
