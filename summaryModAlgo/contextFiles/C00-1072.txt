these are essentially scripts that provide information that is very useful in general reasoning as well as reasoning for nlp (e.g., schank and abelson 1977, lin and hovy 2000, clark and porter 2000). 
to deal with a lot of chinese documents which have free style of writing and flexible themes, a sentence-extraction summarization method created by detecting thematic areas is tried following such work as (nomoto and matsumoto, 2001; salton et al, 1996; salton et al, 1997; carbonell and goldstein, 1998; lin and hovy, 2000). 
the notion of topic signatures was first introduced in (lin and hovy, 2000). 
these n-gram key concepts are called topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000). 
to date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists (lin and pantel 2002), topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000), facts (etzioni et al 2005), and word similarity lists (hindle 1990). 
two methods are used:  topic signature (lin and hovy, 2000): a topic signature is a family of related terms {topic, signature}, where topic is the target concept and signature is a vecto related s. 
while (harabagiu et al, 2005) used topic signatures (lin and hovy, 2000; scenario description the customer has commissioned a research project looking at the impact of the outsourcing of american jobs on the united statesâ€™ relationship with india. 
under this approach, topic representations like those introduced in (lin and hovy, 2000) and (harabagiu, 2004) are used to identify a set of text passages that are relevant to a user's domain of interest. 
to identify these terms,weusethelog-likelihoodstatisticsuggested by dunning (dunning 1993) and first used in summarization by lin and hovy (hovy and lin 2000). 
using these sets we obtained a set of topic signatures (ts) (lin and hovy, 2000) for the spanish geography domain and another set of ts for the non-spanish geography domain. 
in order to generate quabs automatically, documents identified from ferret's automatic q/a system are first submitted to a topic representation module, which computes both topic signatures (lin and hovy, 2000) and enhanced topic signatures (harabagiu, 2004) in order to identify a set of topic-relevant passages. 
this is an extension of lin's method (lin and hovy, 2000). 
a topic signature, as described in (lin and hovy, 2000), is a list of terms that can be used to signal the membership of a text in the relevant topic or category. 
2.2 automatically retrieved topic signatures topic signatures (ts) are word vectors related to a particular topic (lin and hovy, 2000). 
this is similar to the idea of topic signature introduced in (lin and hovy 2000). 
other systems exploit the co-occurrence of particular concepts (barzilay and elhadad, 1997; lin and hovy, 2000) or syntactic constraints between concepts (mckeown et al, 1999). 
we implemented the algorithm described in (lin and hovy, 2000) with the addition of a cutoff, such that the topic signatures for a term are only included if the p1/p2 for that term is greater than the mean p1/p2 over all terms. 
sembled, topic signatures (lin and hovy, 2000; harabagiu 2004) are computed which identify the set of topic-relevant concepts and relations between concepts that are found in the relevant set of documents. 
2 general summarization model many summarization systems (e.g., (teufel and moens, 1997; mckeown et al, 1999; lin and hovy, 2000)) include two levels of analysis: the sentence level, where every textual unit is scored according to c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 t1 1 1 0 1 1 t2 1 0 0 1 0 t3 0 1 0 0 1 t4 1 0 1 1 1 table 1: matrix for summarization model the concepts or features it covers, and the text level, where, before being added to the final output, textual units are compared to each other on the basis of those features.
