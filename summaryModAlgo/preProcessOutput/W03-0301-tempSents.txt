4	it was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems . 
9	the evaluation is done using the performance measures described in : precision, recall and f-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the alignment error rate , which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable. 
5	this data set was used for the 2003 naacl shared task , where the word-aligned sentences were split into a 37 sentencetrial set and a 447 sentence testing set. 
8	we use the data provided for the french-english shared task of the 2003 hltnaacl workshop on building and using parallel texts . 
7	for parameter tuning, we used the 17 sentence trial set from the romanian-english corpus in the 2003 naacl task . 
3	the experiments reported here were carried out using data from the workshop on building and using parallel texts held at hlt-naacl 2003 . 
11	mihalcea and pedersen described a shared task where the goal was to achieve the best aer. 
10	we also compared the performance on the 447 test sentences to 1/ the intersection of the alignments produced by the top ibm4 alignments in either directions, and 2/ the best systems from . 
6	we use a similar graphical structure to the directed hidden markov model from giza++ . 
2	we trained and evaluated our various modifications to model 1 on data from the bilingual word alignment workshop held at hlt-naacl 2003 . 
1	the french/english data were those used by mihalcea and pedersen .
