a similar idea by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005) was proposed forcapturing lexical entailment. 
it was noted recently by geffet and dagan (2004, 2005) that distributional similarity captures a quite loose notion of semantic similarity, as exemplified by the pair country party (identified by lin's similarity measure). 
a similar idea relying on word co-occurrence was proposed by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005)but ourmethodis simpler and we expect it to be applicable to a wider range of vocabularies. 
consequently, they proposed a definition for the lexical entailment relation, which conforms to the general framework of applied textual entailment (dagan et al, 2005).
