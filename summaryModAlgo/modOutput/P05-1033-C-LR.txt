some approaches have used syntax at the core (wu, 1997; alshawi et al, 2000; yamada and knight, 2001; gildea, 2003; eisner, 2003; hearne and way, 2003; melamed, 2004) while others have integrated syntax into existing phrase-based frameworks (xia and mccord, 2004; chiang, 2005; collins et al, 2005; quirk et al, 2005). 
so instead of determinization, here we present a simple-yet-effective extension to the algorithm 3 of huang and chiang (2005) that guarantees to output unique translated strings: • keep a hash-table of unique strings at each vertex in the hypergraph • when asking for the next-best derivation of a vertex, keep asking until we get a new string, and then add it into the hash-table this method should work in general for any equivalence relation (say, same derived tree) that can be defined on derivations.
