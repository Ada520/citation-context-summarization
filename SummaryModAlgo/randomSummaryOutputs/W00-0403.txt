first, our method focuses on subject shift of the documents from the target event rather than the sets of documents from different events (radev et al, 2000). 
among text summarization techniques, there are statistical methods and linguistic methods (radev et al, 2000; marcu et al, 1999). 
but the interpretation of the results is not simple; studies (jing et al 1998; donaway, drummey, and mather 2000; radev, jing, and budzikowska 2000) 404 computational linguistics volume 28, number 4 show how the same summaries receive different scores under different measures or when compared to different (but presumably equivalent) ideal summaries created by humans.
