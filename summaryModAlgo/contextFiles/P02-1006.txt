(ravichandran and hovy 2002) also use bootstrapping, and learn simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from the web. 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2003), and other relations.

for example, ravichandran and hovy (2002) learns rules based on simple surface patterns. 
this makes ures patterns much more general, and allows to recognize instances in sentences inaccessible to the simple surface patterns of systems such as (brin 1998; riloff and jones 1999; ravichandran and hovy 2002). 
many research ideas have exploited the web in unsupervised or weakly supervised algorithms for natural language processing (e.g., resnik (1999), ravichandran and hovy (2002), keller and lapata (2003)).

ravichandran and hovy (2002) focus on scaling relation extraction to the web. 
this method was first described in ravichandran and hovy (2002). 
we compared our system against our reimplementation of ravichandran and hovy’s (2002) paraphrase learning. 
for example, the simple subordinate clause in the following example (taken from (ravichandran and hovy, 2002)) can already prevent a surface pattern matcher from discovering a relation between ”london” and the ”river thames”: ”london, which has one of the busiest airports in the world, lies on the banks of the river thames.” 
we chose the state of the art algorithm described in (ravichandran and hovy 2002) with the following slight modification. 
this may just be the m characters to the left or to the right (brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (agichtein and gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
a few recent works (ravichandran and hovy, 2002; keller et al, 2002; chklovski and pantel, 2004) used the web to collect statistics on word cooccurrences. 
but it is almost impossible to learn such surface text patterns following (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) proposed automatically learning surface text patterns for answer extraction. 
consequently, rote extractors (brin, 1998; agichtein and gravano, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002) have been identified as an appropriate method to look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relation between two concepts. 
while some qa systems are promising (harabagiu, et al, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002), they can only handle factual questions as in trec (voorhees, 2001), and the context for the whole task is largely not considered. 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) present a method to automatically learn surface text patterns expressing relations between instances of classes using a search engine. 
question, we add the word “is usually”, “refers to”, etc. we learn these clue words using the similar method proposed in (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
for the special case of rote extractors, a more attractive alternative has been proposed by brin (1998), agichtein and gravano (2000), and ravichandran and hovy (2002). 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) present an alternative ontology for type preference and describe a method for using this alternative ontology to extract particular answers using surface text patterns. 
in particular, the methodology proposed by ravichandran and hovy (2002) requires no parsing or other language specific resources, so is an ideal candidate for multilingual use. 
table 5: inclusion precision on the same test corpus for our approach and ravichandran and hovy (2002)’s. 
for example, the year of birth of a person is typically expressed using one of these phrases: <name> was born in <birthyear> <name> (<birthyear>–<deathyear>) we have developed a method to learn such patterns automatically from text on the web (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
this idea is based on that of (ravichandran and hovy, 2002) for a qa system. 
unsupervised methods for similar tasks include agichtein and gravano’s (2000) work, which shows that clusters of vector-spacebased patterns can be successfully employed to detect speci c ie relationships (companies and their headquarters), and ravichandran and hovy’s (2002) algorithm for nding patterns for a question answering (qa) task. 
qa researchers have explored a variety of uses of the web, ranging from surface pattern mining (ravichandran et al, 2002), query formulation (yang et al, 2003), answer validation (magnini et al, 2002), to directly finding answers on the web by data redundancy analysis (brill et al, 2001). 
in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is usually followed (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
these patterns could be manually generated, such as the ones described here, or learned from text, as described in ravichandran and hovy (2002). 
our approach extends previously formulated ones that use surface patterns as indicators of semantic relations between nouns (hearst 1992; etzioni 2003; ravichandran and hovy 2002). 
in addition to their use for learning lexical semantic relations, patterns were commonly used to learn instances of concrete semantic relations for information extraction (ie) and qa, as in (riloff and shepherd, 1997; ravichandran and hovy, 2002; yangarber et al, 2000). 
indeed, many researchers have recently tapped the web as a data-source for improving performance on nlp tasks (e.g., resnik (1999), ravichandran and hovy (2002), keller and lapata (2003)). 
we assume that the system has used the seed list to extract and generalise a set of patterns for each of the relations using training corpora (ravichandran and hovy, 2002; alfonseca et al, 2006a). 
several existing works have tried to extract a certain type of relation by manually choosing different pairs of entities (brin, 1998; ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
many recent efforts have also focused on extracting semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (szpektor et al 2004), is-a (ravichandran and hovy 2002), part-of (girju et al 2006), and other relations. 
this requirement has motivated work on qa systems to incorporate knowledge processing components such as semantic representation, ontologies, reasoning and inference engines, e.g., (moldovan et al, 2003), (hovy et al, 2002), (chu-carroll et al, 2003). 
several similar approaches have been proposed (brin, 1998; agichtein and gravano, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002), with various applications: question-answering (ravichandran and hovy, 2002), multi-document named entity coreference (mann and yarowsky, 2003), and generating biographical information (mann and yarowsky, 2005). 
on the other hand, we have rerun ravichandran and hovy (2002)’s algorithm on our corpus. 
see fleischman and hovy (2002) for techniques useful in disambiguating such instances. 
these retrieved text fragments are then considered good candidate for paraphrasing x bought y. anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (ravichandran and hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (szpektor et al, 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented. 
in this case, ravichandran and hovy (2002)  patterns resulted more precise as they do not contain disjunctions or wildcards. 
it is interesting to note that, as could be expected, for those targets for which there is no entity type defined (films, books and pictures), ravichandran and hovy (2002)’s extracts many errors, because it is not possible to apply the named entity recognizer to clean up the results, and the accuracy remains below 10%. 
to obtain such a corpus ravichandran and hovy (2002) mine the web to gather the relevant data. 
to date, researchers have harvested, with varying success, several resources, including concept lists (lin and pantel 2002), topic signatures (lin and hovy 2000), facts (etzioni et al 2005), and word similarity lists (hindle 1990). 
most works that attempt to learn such concrete lexical semantic relations employ a co-occurrence pattern-based approach (hearst, 1992; ravichandran and hovy, 2002; moldovan et al, 2004). 
the approach followed for the generalisation is the one described by (alfonseca et al, 2006a; ruiz-casado et al, in press), which has a few modifications with respect to ravichandran and hovy (2002)'s, such as the use of the wildcard * to represent any sequence of words, and the addition of part-of-speech and named entity labels to the patterns. 
several qa systems have investigated the use of text patterns for qa (soubbotin and soubbotin, 2001), (soubbotin and soubbotin, 2002), (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
the only group that can learn arbitrary binary relations is the group of pattern matching systems (etzioni et al, 2004; agichtein and gravano, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002; brin, 1999; soderland, 1999; xu et al, 2002; ruiz-casado et al, 2005; mann and yarowsky, 2005). 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) have noted that this might be dangerous if the wildcard matches unrestrictedly incorrect sentences. 
as in the original algorithm, all substrings linking terms x and y are then extracted from s x,y , and overall frequencies are computed to form p. pattern ranking/selection in (ravichandran and hovy 2002), a frequency threshold on the patterns in p is set to select the final patterns. 
an interesting approach is that of rote extractors (brin, 1998; agichtein and gravano, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002), which look for textual contexts that happen to convey a certain relationship between two concepts. 
in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is mostly used (ravichandran and hovy, 2002):/
as referred to in the introduction, ravichandran and hovy (2002) present a method to identify surface text patterns using a web search engine. 
this may just be the m characters to the left or to the right, (brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (agichtein and gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (soubbotin, 2002; ravichandran and hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (ittycheriah et al, 2002), have been successful in answering factoid questions, more complex tasks require a consideration of text meaning. 
(ravichandran and hovy, 2002) used pairs of questions and answers to obtain varied patterns which give the same answer. 
the use of lexical patterns to identify answers in corpus-based qa received lots of attention after a team taking part in one of the earlier qa tracks at trec showed that the approach was competitive at that stage (soubbotin and soubbotin, 2002; ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
more recently this method has been applied for structuring terminology in isa hierarchies (morin, 1999) and for learning question-answering patterns (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
in this paper, we employ and extend the method described by ravichandran and hovy (2002) shown in figure 1. 
several similar approaches have been proposed (brin, 1998; agichtein and gravano, 2000; ravichandran and hovy, 2002), with various applications: question-answering (ravichandran and hovy, 2002), multi-document named entity coreference (mann and yarowsky, 2003), and generating 15 biographical information (mann and yarowsky, 2005). 
for example, the following patterns are reported by ravichandran and hovy (2002) for identifying the relations inventor, discoverer and location: relation prec. 
since exhaustive processing of the web is not feasible, (duclaye et al, 2002) and (ravichandran and hovy, 2002) attempted bootstrapping approaches, which resemble the mutual bootstrapping method for information extraction of (riloff and jones, 1999). 
automatic pattern derivation is more appealing (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
in this field as well, the use of pre-defined sets of relation patterns has proved fairly reliable, particularly in the case of factoid type queries (brill et al, 2002; ravichandran and hovy, 2002; hovy et al, 2002; soubbotin and soubbotin, 2002). 
hearst (1992) was the first followed by recent larger-scale and more fully automated efforts (pantel and ravichandran 2004; etzioni et al 2004; ravichandran and hovy 2002). 
ravichandran also explored a similar method for question answering (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
we also used, to a limited extend, a bootstrapping technique to get more data (ravinchandran and hovy 2002), a method that starts by an unambiguous set of anchors (often arguments of a relational term) for a target sense. 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) evaluated the performance of a qa system that is based solely on paraphrases, an approach resembling ours. 
ravichandran and hovy (2002) presents a method that learns patterns from online data using some seed questions and answer anchors.

for instance, ravichandran and hovy (2002) report the following patterns for the relationships inventor, discoverer and location: relation prec.
