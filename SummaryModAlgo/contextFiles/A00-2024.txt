the recent approach for editing extracted text spans (jing and mckeown, 2000) may also produce improvement for our algorithm. 
while this approach exploits only syntactic and lexical information, jing and mckeown (2000) also rely on cohesion information, derived from word distribution in a text: phrases that are linked to a local context are retained, while phrases that have no such links are dropped. 
because of this, it is generally accepted that some kind of postprocessing should be performed to improve the final result, by shortening, fusing, or otherwise revising the material (grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; jing and mckeown 2000; barzilay et al 2000; knight and marcu 2000). 
additionally, some research has explored cutting and pasting segments of text from the full document to generate a summary (jing and mckeown 2000). 
we analyzed a set of articles and identified six major operations that can be used for editing the extracted sentences, including removing extraneous phrases from an extracted sentence, combining a reduced sentence with other sentences, syntactic transformation, substituting phrases in an extracted sentence with their paraphrases, substituting phrases with more general or specific descriptions, and reordering the extracted sentences (jing and mckeown, 1999; jing and mckeown, 2000). 
as previously observed in the literature (mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; jing and mckeown 2000), such components include a clause in the clause conjunction, relative clauses, and some elements within a clause (such as adverbs and prepositions). 
we found that the deletion of lead parts did not occur very often in our summary, unlike the case of jing and mckeown (2000). 
5.3 related works and discussion our two-step model essentially belongs to the same category as the works of (mani et al, 1999) and (jing and mckeown, 2000). 
jing and mckeown (2000) proposed a system based on extraction and cut-and-paste generation.ù 
but in fact, the issue of editing in text summarization has usually been neglected, notable exceptions being the works by jing and mckeown (2000) and mani, gates, and bloedorn (1999). 
in addition to sentence fusion, compression algorithms (chandrasekar, doran, and bangalore 1996; grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999; knight and marcu 2002; jing and mckeown 2000; reizler et al 2003) and methods for expansion of a multiparallel corpus (pang, knight, and marcu 2003) are other instances of such methods.

previous research has addressed revision in single-document summaries [jing & mckeown, 2000] [mani et al, 1999] and has suggested that revising summaries can make them more informative and correct errors. 
jing and mckeown (2000) have proposed a rule-based algorithm for sentence combination, but no results have been reported. 
jing and mckeown (2000) and jing (2000) propose a cut-and-paste strategy as a computational process of automatic abstracting and a sentence reduction strategy to produce concise sentences. 
our work in sentence reformulation is different from cut-and-paste summarization (jing and mckeown 2000) in many ways. 
to contrast, [jing & mckeown, 2000] concentrated on analyzing human-written summaries in order to determine how professionals construct summaries. 
text-to-text generation is an emerging area of research in nlp (chandrasekar and bangalore, 1997; caroll et al, 1999; knight and marcu, 2000; jing and mckeown, 2000). 
while earlier approaches for text compression were based on symbolic reduction rules (grefenstette 1998; mani, gates, and bloedorn 1999), more recent approaches use an aligned corpus of documents and their human written summaries to determine which constituents can be reduced (knight and marcu 2002; jing and mckeown 2000; reizler et al 2003). 
in addition to reducing the original sentences, jing and mckeown (2000) use a number of manually compiled rules to aggregate reduced sentences; for example, reduced clauses might be conjoined with and.
