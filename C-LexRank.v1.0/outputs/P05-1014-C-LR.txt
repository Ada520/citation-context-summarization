consequently, they proposed a definition for the lexical entailment relation, which conforms to the general framework of applied textual entailment (dagan et al, 2005). 
it was noted recently by geffet and dagan (2004, 2005) that distributional similarity captures a quite loose notion of semantic similarity, as exemplified by the pair country party (identified by lin's similarity measure). 
the method for noun entailment acquisition by (geffet and dagan, 2005) is based on the idea of distributional inclusion, according to which one noun is entailed by the other if the set of occurrence contexts of the former subsumes that of the latter. 
a similar idea relying on word co-occurrence was proposed by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005)but ourmethodis simpler and we expect it to be applicable to a wider range of vocabularies. 
a similar idea by geffet and dagan (geffet and dagan, 2005) was proposed forcapturing lexical entailment.
