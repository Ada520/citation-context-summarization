we do not use particular lexicosyntactic patterns, as previous attempts have (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
data fleischman et al (2003) describe a dataset of concept-instance pairs extracted automatically from a very large corpus of newspaper articles. 
the recall problem is usually addressed by increasing the amount of text data for extraction (taking larger collections (fleischman et al, 2003)) or by developing more surface patterns (soubbotin and soubbotin, 2002). 
in contrast, the idea of bootstrapping for relation and information extraction was first proposed in (riloff and jones, 1999), and successfully applied to the construction of semantic lexicons (thelen and riloff, 2002), named entity recognition (collins and singer, 1999), extraction of binary relations (agichtein and gravano, 2000), and acquisition of structured data for tasks such as question answering (lita and carbonell, 2004; fleischman et al, 2003).
