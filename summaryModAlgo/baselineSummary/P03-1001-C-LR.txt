we do not use particular lexicosyntactic patterns, as previous attempts have (hearst, 1992; caraballo, 1999; imasumi, 2001; fleischman et al, 2003; morin and jacquemin, 2003; ando et al, 2003). 
fleischman et al (2003) focus on the precision of the information extracted using simple part-of-speech patterns. 
the precision of the extracted information can be improved significantly by using machine learning methods to filter out noise (fleischman et al, 2003). 
in particular, we use the name/instance lists described by (fleischman et al, 2003) and available on fleischman's web page to generate features between names and nominals (this list contains a110a111a85 pairs mined from a112a73a96 gbs of news data).
