for evaluation, we are using the rouge evaluation toolkit, which is a method based on ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (lin and hovy, 2003a). 
it is also notable the study reported in (lin and hovy, 2003b) discussing the usefulness and limitations of automatic sentence extraction for summarization, which emphasizes the need of accurate tools for sentence extraction, as an integral part of automatic summarization systems. 
for evaluation, we are using the rouge evaluation toolkit1, which is a method based on ngram statistics, found to be highly correlated with human evaluations (lin and hovy, 2003a). 
another notable development in the field is the uni-gram co-occurrence matching technique as proposed in (lin and hovy, 2003a). 
let us imagine, for instance, that the best metric turns out to be a rouge (lin and hovy, 2003a) variant that only considers unigrams to compute similarity.
