although none of the previous results on labeling accuracy is strictly comparable to ours, it nevertheless seems fair to conclude that the 6this f-measure is based on the recall and precision figures reported in figure 7.15 in collins (1999). 
so, collins et al (1999) proposed a tag classification for parsing the czech treebank. 
we should note that the results in collins et al (1999) are different then reported here due to different training and testing data sets. 
finally the placement of punctuation signs has a major impact on the performance of a parser (collins et al, 1999). 
although the best published results for the collins parser is 80% uas (collins, 1999), this parser reaches 82% when trained on the entire training data set, and an adapted version of charniak's parser (charniak, 2000) performs at 84% (jan hajiË‡c, pers.
