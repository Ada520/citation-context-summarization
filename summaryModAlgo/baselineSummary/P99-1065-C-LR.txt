constituency parsing for dependency trees a pragmatic justification for using constituencybased parsers in order to predict dependency structures is that currently the best czech dependencytree parser is a constituency-based parser (collins et al, 1999; zeman, 2004). 
so, collins et al (1999) proposed a tag classification for parsing the czech treebank. 
more precisely, parsing accuracy is measured by the attachment score, which is a standard measure used in studies of dependency parsing (eisner, 1996; collins et al, 1999). 
to reduce sparseness, our features rely only on the reduced pos tag set from collins et al (1999). 
although the best published results for the collins parser is 80% uas (collins, 1999), this parser reaches 82% when trained on the entire training data set, and an adapted version of charniak's parser (charniak, 2000) performs at 84% (jan hajiË‡c, pers.
