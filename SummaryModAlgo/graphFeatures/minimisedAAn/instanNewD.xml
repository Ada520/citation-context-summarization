<nextsent>t rans laing wi th :lsomorphle m-grammars the translation relation between two (or more) lan-guages is defined by at tuning their grammars as follows: (i) for each basic expression of grammar there is at least one corresponding basic expression of the other grammar with the same meaning.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>313 (ii) for each syntactic rule of grammar there is at least one corresponding syntactic rule of the other grammar, with the same meaning.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the correspondence between rules is only required for  meaningful  rules.

<prevsent>this seems inadequate in view of sentences that can have both an imperfect ive and retrospective aspect ual relation as in e.g.

<prevsent>(10) and (ll).

the complexit:y of the aspect nal relation is also recognized in maegaard (1982) <papid> C82-2046 </papid>where special value continuous for the attribute retrospectve was intro-duced for the translation of verbal tenses.</citsent>
<aftsection>
<nextsent>krauwer and des tombe (1985) make similar observa-tions.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>i propose therefore that in the rosetta framework i) time meaning representation obligatorily will contain an aspeetual relation, i.e. relation be-tween and reference interval r~, which will be called perfect ive if is subset ~ e and imperfee--t~ve~f~r~ is subset of , and ~) t~at .it can bptionally contain retrospective relation between e and time p~int rs, which is sone  local l?}int of evaluation  , meaning that ~( lasts until s. this r_ is an arbitrary point of some reference interval.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>consider for example- (17) yesterday john had been living there for 3 years the 3 years (re) last until some point during yesterday (rs).
</nextsent>
<nextsent>if there is no retrospective relation, s will he an arbitrary point of f. between s and th~ d~-~ctic relation is specified: past (r  is before s), present ( s is simultaneous w~ s)%r ~:,~f~r~ ~h is ~t~t s).

let us define the attribute  sequence  (seq) as having the values i: precedes h, and 2: follows h. let us establish  adjacency  (adj) with the values i: im-mediately precedes 1{, and 2: immediately follows h, finally, let us introduce  delimitation  (lim) with the values i: is the left most of all of the strings corresponding to dependents of h, and 2: is the rightmost of of all of the dependents of h. for the sake of comparison, let us consider the following ex-ample which pereira 1981 <papid> J81-4003 </papid>uses in order to illustrate extra position grammar: (3) the mouse that the cat that likes fish chased squeaks, the following drl-tree depicts the dependencies and the word order of this sentence by means of the at-tributes just defined: (4) (illocution: assertion: adj  (predicate: squeak: adj  (subject: mouse: adj  (determiner: the: seq ) (attribute: chase: adj 2  (object: that: lim ) (subject: cat: adj  (determiner: the: adj ) (attribute: like: adj 2  (subject: that: lim ) (object: fish: adj 2 ))))))); the projection of subtrees and their attributes yields the following constituent analysis of the in- put string: (5) the mouse that the cat that \[ squeaks likes fish chased \[ adj  the \[ , mouse - - ~ \[ that the cat seq  adj 2  \] that likes \[ \] fish chased that \[ +-- - - chased \[ lim  tile cat that likes fish \[   adj  the *- cat - - ~ \[ that likes fish adj  adj 2  that \] ~ - - - i e - - ~ \] fish lim  adj 2  there is exactly one sequence of words that is in agreement with all of the attribute-values in the ree . it is likely that appropriate attributes can also be defined for more difficult cases of extrapo- sition.</citsent>

<nextsent>since the dislocated elements continue to be subordinated to their heads in their original role, no  gaps ,  holes  or  ltraces  are part of tile drl- formalism.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the possibility to do without such enti-ties is attractive.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>it arises from the fact that the ratio of constituency and dependency is reversed in dug.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>it seems to be easier to augment dependency trees by onstituency information than to process de-pendency features within phrase markers.

<prevsent>for language and category c, the x2 rule above constructs imrse tree containing nodal information (category and what will become phrasal features) followed by the specifier, the x1 sub-structure, and any ~-ad juncts (e.g. pp modifiers).

<nextsent>the rule in (5) is used for all major phrasal categories, i.e. np,vp,ap,pp, as well as the clausal phrases comp (=s-bar) ar~ infl (~) (stowell 1981).
</nextsent>
<nextsent>(it should be pointed out that (5) reflects head- initial gran~nars.

<nextsent>a simple parameter could be inserted to aocommodate head-final grammars, such as for sov languages like german, but this introduces parsing problems for prolog.

<prevsent>the implementation this facility through stuart shieber, however, raised interesting problems in connection with the prediction aspect of the earley-parser.

<citsent citstr=" P85-1018 ">
an answer to these problems was presented by shieber (1985) <papid> P85-1018 </papid>who proposed to do earley prediction on the basis of some finite quotient of all constituent dags which can be specified by the grammar writer.</citsent>

<nextsent>another example for the influence of the cug efforts on the development of patr is new template notation introduced by lauri karttunen in his interlisp-d version of patr.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>since categorial grammars exhibit an extensive embedding of categories within other categories, it is useful to unify templates not only with the whole lexical dag but also with its categorial subgraphs.
</nextsent>
<nextsent>the @-notation permits this use of templates (karttunen, 1986)3
</nextsent>
<nextsent>order variation worder order variation has always been one of the hardest problems for categorial grammars.
