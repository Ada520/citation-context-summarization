in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is usually followed (ravichandran and hovy, 2002). 
these retrieved text fragments are then considered good candidate for paraphrasing x bought y. anchor-based learning methods have been used to investigate many semantic relations ranging from very general ones as the isa relation in (morin, 1999) to very specific ones as in (ravichandran and hovy, 2002) where paraphrases of question-answer pairs are searched in the web or as in (szpektor et al, 2004) where a method to scan the web for searching textual entailment prototype relations is presented. 
table 5: inclusion precision on the same test corpus for our approach and ravichandran and hovy (2002)â€™s. 
in order to train a rote extractor from the web, this procedure is mostly used (ravichandran and hovy, 2002):/
this may just be the m characters to the left or to the right (brin, 1998), the longest common substring of several contexts (agichtein and gravano, 2000), or all substrings obtained with a suffix tree constructor (ravichandran and hovy, 2002).
