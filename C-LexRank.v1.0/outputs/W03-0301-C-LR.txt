we use the data provided for the french-english shared task of the 2003 hltnaacl workshop on building and using parallel texts (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
this data set was used for the 2003 naacl shared task (mihalcea and ped-ersen, 2003), where the word-aligned sentences were split into a 37 sentencetrial set and a 447 sentence testing set. 
the evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and f-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the alignment error rate (aer), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable. 
the experiments reported here were carried out using data from the workshop on building and using parallel texts held at hlt-naacl 2003 (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
mihalcea and pedersen (2003) described a shared task where the goal was to achieve the best aer.
