(bos and markert, 2005; corley and mihalcea, 2005; jijkoun and de rijke, 2005; glickman et al, 2006)) applied or utilized lexical based word overlap measures. 
also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in corley and mihalcea (2005). 
in line with (corley and mihalcea, 2005), we define it as: s1(t,h) = summationdisplay (wt,wh)∈a simw(wt,wh)×idf(wh) summationdisplay wh∈wh idf(wh) (3) where idf(w) is the inverse document frequency of the word w. 
third, the dramatic improvement observed in (corley and mihalcea, 2005) on the dataset “train:d1-test:t1” is given by the idf rather than the use of the j-c similarity (second vs. third columns). 
although these implications are uncontroversial, their automatic recognition is complex if we rely on models based on lexical distance (or similarity) between hypothesis and text, e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005). 
the wn::similarity package (pedersen et al, 2004) to compute the jiang&conrath (j-c) distance (jiang and conrath, 1997) as in (corley and mihalcea, 2005). 
second, we can use one of the wordnet (miller, 1995) similarities indicated with d(lw,lwprime) (in line with what was done in (corley and mihalcea, 2005)) and different relation between words such as the lexical entailment between verbs (ent) and derivationally relation between words (der). 
our approach is in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005; glickman et al, 2005)). 
a first class of methods defines measures of the distance or similarity between t and h either assuming the independence between words (corley and mihalcea, 2005; glickman et al, 2005) in a bag-of-word fashion or exploiting syntactic interpretations (kouylekov and magnini, 2005). 
table 1: experimental results lexical similarity siml(t,h) as defined in (corley and mihalcea, 2005). 
in line with many other researches (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)), we determine these anchors using different similarity or relatedness dectors: the exact matching between tokens or lemmas, a similarity between tokens based on their edit distance, the derivationally related form relation and the verb entailment relation in wordnet, and, finally, a wordnet-based similarity (jiang and conrath, 1997). 
then, we use this cross-pair similarity with more traditional intra-pair similarities (e.g., (corley and mihalcea, 2005)) to define a novel kernel function. 
first, as observed in (corley and mihalcea, 2005) the lexical-based distance kernel kl shows an accuracy significantly higher than the random baseline, i.e. 
we also used the following resources: the charniak parser (charniak, 2000) to carry out the syntactic analysis; the wn::similaritypackage (pedersen et al, 2004) to compute the jiang-conrath (j-c) distance (jiang and conrath, 1997) needed to implement the lexical similarity siml(t,h) as defined in (corley and mihalcea, 2005); svm-lighttk (moschitti, 2004) to encode the basic tree kernel function, kt , in svm-light (joachims, 1999). 
it has already been applied in this way by corley & mihalcea (2005) and wu (2005). 
the system performance reported in (cm05; (corley and mihalcea, 2005)), which is among the best we are aware of, is also included for comparison. 
pr systems that can be broadly categorized as ir-based include (corley and mihalcea, 2005; brockett and dolan, 2005).
