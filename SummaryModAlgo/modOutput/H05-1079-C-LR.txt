we show comparable results from recent systems based on lexical similarity (jijkoun and de rijke, 2005), graph alignment (haghighi et al, 2005), weighted abduction (raina et al, 2005), and a mixed system including theorem proving (bos and markert, 2005). 
many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (bayer et al, 2005; bos and markert, 2005; raina et al, 2005; tatu and moldovan, 2005). 
for example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (tatu and moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (bos and markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. 
these transformations are logical rules in (bos and markert, 2005) or sequences of allowed rewrite rules in (de salvo braz et al, 2005). 
(bos and markert, 2005; corley and mihalcea, 2005; jijkoun and de rijke, 2005; glickman et al, 2006)) applied or utilized lexical based word overlap measures.
