it was the basis for a system that performed very well in a comparison of several alignment systems (dejean et al, 2003; mihalcea and pedersen, 2003). 
we use a similar graphical structure to the directed hidden markov model (hmm) from giza++ (och and ney, 2003). 
the evaluation is done using the performance measures described in (mihalcea and pedersen, 2003): precision, recall and f-score on the probable and sure alignments, as well as the alignment error rate (aer), which in our case is a weighted average of the recall on the sure alignments and the precision on the probable. 
mihalcea and pedersen (2003) described a shared task where the goal was to achieve the best aer.
