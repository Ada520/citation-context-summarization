for algorithms whose packed representations are graphs, such as hidden markov models and other nitestate methods, ratnaparkhiâ€™s mxparse parser (ratnaparkhi, 1997), and many stack-based machine translation decoders (brown et al, 1995; och and ney, 2004), the k-best paths problem is well-studied in both pure algorithmic context (see (eppstein, 2001) and (brander and sinclair, 1995) for surveys) and nlp/speech community (mohri, 2002; mohri and riley, 2002). 
an aligned phrase pair is consistent with the word alignment if neither phrase contains any word aligning to a word outside the other phrase (och and ney, 2004). 
we compare our syntax-based system against an implementation of the alignment template (altemp) approach to mt (och and ney, 2004), which is widely considered to represent the state of the art in the field.
